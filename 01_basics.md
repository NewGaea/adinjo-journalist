# The Basics of Journalist

> **NOTE:** From this point on, the terms **Adinjo** and **Journalist** will be used interchangeably.

I don't expect you to read the whole book in one sitting, so this chapter will provide a simple outline of the most essential elements of Adinjo: Sentence structure, glossing conventions, roman orthography, and key concepts for all students.

## Romanization

This book does not use Adin script or fonts, so everything is presented in _romanized_ form, using the simplest Latin script possible. This most complicated linguistic documentation for this book is how to read and pronounce Adinjo, which we are presenting in a simple table.

| Romanization | Pronunciation | &nbsp; | Romanization | Pronunciation |
|:------------:|:-------------:|:---:|:------------:|:-------------:|
| **a** | _f<u>a</u>ther_ | | **á** | _f<u>a</u>t_ |
| **b** | _<u>b</u>ath_ | | **c** | _ra<u>ts</u>_ |
| **ch, ç** | _<u>ch</u>eese_ | | **d** | _<u>d</u>og_ |
| **dh** | _<u>th</u>en_ | | **e** | _<u>e</u>nd_ |
| **é** | _n<u>a</u>me_ | | **f** | _<u>f</u>ade_ |
| **g** | _bi<u>g</u>_ | | **h** | _<u>h</u>otel, a-<u>h</u>a_ |
| **i** | _h<u>i</u>ll_ | | **í** | _h<u>ea</u>t_ |
| **j** | _mea<u>s</u>ure_ | | **dj** | _<u>j</u>ewel_ |

In the table, each letter (or letter combination), is presented on the left, with a word reflecting that sound on the right. The underlined portion of the word is the sound produced by the letter. While no guarantee is made that all dialects of English pronounce these words the same, a so-called General American dialect is the model used to define how these words are pronounced.
