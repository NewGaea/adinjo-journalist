## Statement

We believe that languages, natural and artificial, do not belong in the field of content which should be covered by copyright law. Despite our belief, we recognize that the matter is not settled, and that even if a language as a whole cannot be subject to copyright, the individual works of documentation can be and are. To that end, we have decided to select the following two sets of licensing for Adinjo Journalist.

## Documentation License

<table><tr><td align="center"><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png" /></a><br/>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.</td></tr></table>

The **documentation** of this language is licensed for redistribution, remixing, re-working, and any other use under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. This means you are free to do whatever you like, including selling copies of it, so long as you provide proper attribution and share your work under the same license terms.

### Attribution

> You must give [appropriate credit](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/#), provide a link to the license, and [indicate if changes were made](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/#). You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use. (from _[creativecommons.org](creativecommons.org)_)

Because this language may have multiple contributors, Attribution should be given to **New Gaea Entertainment** and **GaeaJen** and requires no less than a list of the Names identified in the **Contributors** directory of this repository.

For distributions of this project in repository or other electronic directory tree formats, this should include _the entire **`Contributors`** directory,_ along with added attribution for any contributors who have added to your distribution and desire attribution.

### ShareAlike

> If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the [same license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/#) as the original.

**New Gaea Entertainment** believes that languages, natural and artificial, are vital tools for communication and thus are a part of **Free Culture,** and should never be distributed in a manner that restricts their further redistribution, even if they have been altered, remixed, transformed, or built upon.

This license file must be included in any redistribution of this **Adinjo** language, even if you replace the Creative Commons license (and references thereto) with another compatible license as defined by the Creative Commons.

### No additional restrictions

> You may not apply legal terms or [technological measures](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/#) that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.

You may not distribute copies of this documentation which are encrypted or bundled with any type of License Agreement, DRM, restrictions, or means of abrogation of the CC-BY-SA-4.0 license.

### Derivative Languages

It is the view of **New Gaea Entertainment** that these license terms imply the following:

+ You are free, under the terms of this license, to derive your own language or languages from this language, provided that any derivative language shares the same license terms, or compatible license terms. You do not need to reach out for permission to do this, our chosen License allows you to derive any number of languages from this version of **Adinjo Journalist** as you wish.

## Linguistic Use License

You are free to use the linguistic documentation in this Work to generate new and original expressions of creativity using the Language defined herein. **New Gaea Entertainment** only lays copyright to the creative work of this iteration of the linguistic documentation, such as the structure and wording of the instructive and descriptive texts, text samples, and literature or other creative works included specifically within the documentation.

Using the knowledge provided in the grammars, and the words defined in the lexicons, you may create any new work you desire without need for attribution to any party under any license, provided that your work is novel and original -- translations of other works are subject to the licenses of the works being translated.

If you wish to translate a commercially licensed product, whether you will be releasing it commercially or not, we would appreciate you sending a request our way so we know about it.
