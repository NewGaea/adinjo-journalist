# README #

Welcome to the Adinjo repository.

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is for the Original Adin language, now called Adinjo Journalist. It will consist of the grammar, lexicon, and other materials for use in the Adinjo Journalist.

* Mainstream commits for Adinjo Journalist language
* All documentation produced in Markdown, with inline HTML where necessary.
* Fonts and Images of Adin script

### How do I get set up? ###

It is recommended that you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or any similar modern text editor installed to edit and preview Markdown. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is preferred for access to plugins used by the vault for some formatting features, though as of March 2024, we do not synchronize our Obsidian plugins with GitHub.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Translations - Submit Markdown files to the /texts directory to request or suggest translations. Currently only English language texts, or foreign texts with an accompanying English translation, may be requested
* Samples - You may submit images (SVG, PNG, or JPG) or recordings (MP3 or OGG) of the Adin language. Use the /samples directory to add these samples.
* You may suggest or request words in the /collab directory.

### Who do I talk to? ###
