This is the current roadmap for development of Adinjo Journalist V4.

# Distinctive Sounds
Adinjo has a selection of sounds that are meant to help it sound distinct from other languages. While these languages are not themselves unique, the combination is, and it is my hope to start recognizing and using these distinctive sounds more often. A variety of established words may be tweaked to use these distinctive sounds.

# Word Origins: Atlantean vs. Loans
I plan to start assessing a number of words for their likelihood of being a loan word for the sake of historical linguistics. This will help in later developing Proto-Adinjo, as it will give a stronger sense of what words do belong in different historical eras, and thus which should be subjected to sound changes and to how far back they should remain.

# Adobat Update
Coupled with the list of **Distinctive Sounds**, I'd like to update the _adobat_, the native script, to better represent these distinctive sounds, and to be a little bit more alphabetic. Don't worry! The old adobat isn't going away, and none of the pre-2024 letterforms will be changing (or at least, not much), but some new letters will be added to reduce the reliance of adobat script on digraphs for officially standard and distinctive sounds (though this makes no promises of such for romanized text).

# Word of the Day
As of 1 January 2024, there will be a **single** word of the day chosen from the over 1000 words in the lexicon, with no repeats for at least two years. These words may occasionally be new coinages, especially related to translation projects, but will always look into the word of the day a bit further than just their English glosses!

You will be able to find a monthly file in the repository under [lexicon/wotd/24/](lexicon/wotd/24/_root.md), and these Words of the Day will also be posted on the Discord server for the Hylian Linguistic Society.
