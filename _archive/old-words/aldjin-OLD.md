### Derivation ###

**aldjin** is originally derived from the words **ald** 'old' and **mer√ßin** 'blood' to describe a distinct subset of the population; it has been extended to refer to established experts or those who are recognized for their family. There is some debate about whether or not **aldjin** is related to **dyn** 'person' at all.
