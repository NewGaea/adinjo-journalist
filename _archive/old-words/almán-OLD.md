alm치n

**alm치n** _noun_

1. a leader, as of a group or team
2. a leader or ruler appointed without regard for qualifications, usually for a short term until a properly qualified leader can be appointed
3. a leader without the will to lead or govern

**Alm치nu** are always considered to be leaders by circumstance, rather than leaders by profession or training. They may be fully qualified, they may have _the will to lead_ as noted in definition three, but they are seen as short-term leaders of necessity or circumstance, who did not choose to be in the leadership position.

### Other Forms

### Derivation

The word **alman** is derived from the words **alma** _to lead_ and the diminutive suffix -**yn** from **dyn** _person_. This derivation is still meaningful, but unlike most derivations involving _y_, _yn_ serves to accent the preceding vowel rather than acting as _i_ in a diphthong.
