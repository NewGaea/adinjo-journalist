# Adin Words & History: A study in Adin Linguistics
The following table is a layout for the tables used elsewere in this document.

The charts show the derivation of words from Proto Indo-European through modern Adinjo. This includes which of the four tribal variants spawned the origins of each word, as illustrated above and demonstrated below. Note: The tribal variants are proto-languages much like Proto-Adinjo, as there were more than a dozen distinct languages being used by the Adin Tribes at the time of Xronus who led the Panther Tribe to conquer and unite all of them into one nation.

| Pre-Adinjo | Proto-Adinjo | Tribal Adinjo | Old Adinjo | Classic Adinjo | Middle Adinjo | Refined Adinjo | Modern Adinjo |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
|            |              | oénʦè         | ʦoeŋ       | ʦuŋ            | suk           | soúkè          | súg           |
| óinos      | oensè        | wenʦ          | ʦuen       | ʣuiŋ           | ʤyuŋ          | ʒyn            | dyn           |
|            |              | óʔnas         | ʔont       | taŋ            | teŋ           | danʦ           | dan           |
|            |              | uinʦa         | inʦ        | ent            | xaŋʦ          | huìns          | win           |

```
PIE   → PAJ   → TAJ    → OAJ  → CAJ  → MAJ   → RAJ    → ADJ
              → oénʦè  → ʦoeŋ → ʦuŋ  → suk   → soúkè  → súg
óinos → oensè → wenʦ   → ʦuen → ʣuiŋ → ʤyuŋ  → ʒyn    → dyn
              → óʔnas  → ʔont → taŋ  → teŋ   → danʦ   → dan
              → uinʦa  → inʦ  → ent  → xaŋʦ  → huìns  → win
```
  

*oinos* and *oensè* are prototypical words which showcase the diversity of sound changes experienced in the four tribal proto-languages and their descendant roots in the later stages of Adinjo. The four tribal languages were each distinct, though they did often need to speak amongst each other.

The line for PIE and PAJ will attempt to line up to the TAJ family which had the most "similar" form, though this is subjective in the eyes of the languages' creator, and may not always match the line which is most like the PAJ form in Modern Adinjo (ADJ).

# Proto-Adinjo

The protolanguage is partially derived from proto-indoeuropean and partially composed of original coinings, and it has a preference for words to end with closure in the form of a stop, or with a vowel. The vowels also tend to be pronounced lower than in PIE, giving a softer flow.

- **Consonants**: ʔ, p, t, k, b, d, g, h, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, n, m, x, r
- **Vowels**: a, e, i, o \<w>, u \<y>
	- /u/ and /y/ are the same phoneme in PAJ
	- /o/ and /w/ are the same phoneme in PAJ
- **Modifiers**: asent, è

Alternate sounds

### REGULAR CHANGES:
- /o/ before V tends to become more rounded, nearing \/w/
- Final vowels move towards a medial position if possible
### IRREGULAR CHANGES:
#### PIE to PAJ
- Vowels remain the same when word initial (V>V/#_)
- Vowels drop their articulation when transitioning from Voiced to Unvoiced consonants (ie: í>i, i>e, e>à, à>a)
- Laryngeals (???)

# Tribal Adinjo

## Coastal Adinjo
The coastal language favored vowel clusters and gliding sounds. This language raised medial vowels from the protolanguage, and tended to add glides between consonants. They also preferred unvoiced sounds such as /t/, /f/, and /k/ to their voiced counterparts. If a word in Adinjo has more than two vowels in a row, or a semi-vowel between two vowels, it probably descended from Coastal.

- **Consonants**: h, n, t, s, p, f, w, l, ʔ
- **Vowels**: a, e, i, o, u
	- **Modifiers**: all vowel modifiers
- **Alternate sounds**: N/A
### REGULAR CHANGES:
- /s/ followed by any high vowel (as á) is pronounced /ʃ/
- /ns/ may be realized in several ways, all phonemically equal:
	- /nʦ/ is the most common realization of /ns/
		- /nʧ]/ replaces /nʦ/ prior to a high vowel
	- /n.s/ occurs when /ns/ is not word final
	- /nz/ may also occur in the above contexts
		- /nʒ/ replaces /nz/ prior to a high vowel.
	- /nʣ/ and /nʤ/ may occur, but only before /o/ and /ó/ respectively
	- lastly, all of the above with a /t/ or /d/ component may replace the /n/ with /ŋ/
- /t/ followed by any low vowel (as è) is pronounced /Ɵ/
- /n/ followed by /p/ or /f/ may be pronounced as either /n/ or /ɱ/

### IRREGULAR CHANGES
- /v/ prior to a low vowel is phonemically equal to /f/
- /v/ prior to a high vowel is phonemically equal to /w/
- /r/ is phonemically equal to /l/
- word-final /n/ is sometimes pronounced [ŋ]
	- this same pronunciation can occur before a /t/

## Mountain Adinjo
The mountain language preferred a larger inventory of shorter, sharper sounds. They tended to round the beginning of words as a single sound, especially if the word began with an /o/ or /u/ like sound. They also were more sharp in their use of the glottal stop and had a distinct epiglottal fricative. Mountain Adinjo also distinguished between voiced and unvoiced /x/, which no other form of Adinjo did phonemically.

### Features
- **Consonants**: b, p, t, d, k, g, x, ɣ, n, m , ʜ, ʢ, h, w, ʔ
- **Vowels**: a, e, i, o, u
	- **Modifiers**: all vowel modifiers
- **Alternate sounds**: N/A

### REGULAR CHANGES:
- Word-final stops acquire the nonce phone /s/ or /z/
- Geminate stops become fricative
- Geminate nasals become palatalized
- Geminate vowels are followed by /ʔ/
- Word-final vowels become r-flavored.

### IRREGULAR CHANGES:
- Geminate consonants /CC/ may become /ʔC/
- Vowel clusters /VV/ may be pronounced /VʔV/
- Word Final /n/ tends to become /nt/ or /nd/

## Field Adinjo
The field language was the language of nomads and grazers, and tended to have a strong (C)VC structure. The lack of vowel clusters made the language sound simple and blunt, and they spoke with vowels that came from higher and more forward in the mouth. Like the coast, they had a preference for unvoiced sounds and had a series of palatalized consonants that were used where other Adinjo languages tended to voice a sound. Field Adinjo is the primary source of palatal and geminate sounds in later forms of Adinjo.

### Features
- **Consonants**: p, t, k, pʲ, tʲ, kʲ, n, m, nʲ, mʲ, r, l, lʲ, ʔ, h, hʲ
- **Vowels**: a, e, i, o, u
	- **Modifiers**: asent, è
- **Alternate sounds**: N/A
### REGULAR CHANGES:
- Stops are voiced before /r/
- Palatals may form /CC/ syllables with an implicit /ì/
### IRREGULAR CHANGES:
- Stops may become a voiced palatal before /ú/

## Forest Adinjo
The forest language was the only language with a general preference for voiced sounds, though this was more of a relative preference. In spite of this preference, they had the most diverse language, which is reflected in the syllabic alphabet (an abugida) which they first developed. The choice of letters represented here was often pairs of phones, grouped in pairs of voiced and unvoiced. Forest Adinjo was fond of clusters more than any other linguistic feature or quirk, and of long words.

### Features
- **Consonants**: b, p, d, t, ʦ, v, f, g, k, h, x, l, m, n, r, z, s, v, w, j
	- **Phonemic Digraphs**: \<th> /Ɵ/, \<dh> /ð/, \<sh> /ʃ/, \<zh> /ʒ/, \<ny> /nʲ/, \<ng> /ŋ/, \<ʦh> /ʧ/, \<dʒ> /ʤ/
	- **Non-Phonemic Sounds**: ʔ, palatals (except /nʲ/)
- **Vowels**: a, e, i, o, u
	- **Modifiers**: all vowel modifiers
- **Alternate sounds**: N/A

### REGULAR CHANGES:
- Geminate consonants always become /C:C/ or /CʔC/
- /Cy/ will tend to produce the closest palatal approximation, or will insert a /ʔ/ in the middle

### IRREGULAR CHANGES:
- /ʦ/ may be pronounced as /ʧ/ before front asent vowels as [á]
- /ʒ/ may be pronounced as /ʤ/ before high vowels

# OLD ADINJO

Old Adinjo was a forced unification under the hands of XRÓNUS of the panther tribe, a speaker of the forest language. As a native of the forest, he showed many quirks of this in bringing the four languages together, some of which show irregularities in his own rules, while others merely pay tribute to the fact that the other languages were not, in fact, his own.

The greatest quirk of this is the fact that most roots in XRÓNUS' language follow the field-like (C)VC structure, at least in their first syllable, rather than the more complex consonant clusters that were the hallmark of Forest. Whether this was a concession or a true preference of XRÓNUS is uncertain.

The longest lasting trace of XRÓNUS in Adinjo is the insistence that the letter /y/ is realized /ji/ and the letter /w/ as [wʌ] whenever they are _not_ followed by a vowel, including word-finally, and that these same letters serve as both consonant and vowel.
