# Welcome to Lexember 2019

It‚Äôs that time of year again!

For those not aware, **Lexember** is an annual month-long celebration of the lexicon (or ‚Äúdictionary‚Äù). The challenge: every day in the month of December, add at least one new word to your conlang.

I ran this last year and received a ton of interesting feedback. Because of that feedback, I‚Äôll be running this year a little differently so that it‚Äôs fun, interesting, and productive for as many participants as possible (although, it is truly impossible to please everyone).

First of all, we are removing the competition aspect of Lexember. Last year, the user who had the most aggregate upvotes won the special golden flair (that winner was [u/roipoiboy](https://www.reddit.com/u/roipoiboy/), who has now traded that for a purple flair). It was added last year because it had been a while since our last official contest, but some feedback said that the competition aspect was demotivating and unfair (plus, it was a lot of work for me to stay on track of it all). This year, you may create freely without fear or intimidation! Comments will still be in ‚Äúcontest mode‚Äù so that everyone has a shot to be featured at the top and upvotes are out of sight and out of mind (but feel free to upvote anyway).

Because there is no competition aspect, there are fewer rules and stipulations than before. This means you can go wild like a caffeinated toddler with a kazoo. However, there is still this rule: **All top-level comments must contain the word(s) you have added to your lexicon for that day.** I think that‚Äôs pretty reasonable, don‚Äôt you?

Second of all, let‚Äôs talk about prompts. Last year, I issued three prompts for participants to follow as they added to their lexicon. Some of them were hits while others were misses. This year, you are not obligated to follow any of the provided prompts, but some will be provided!

Every day, I‚Äôll give three loosely related prompts.

1. An interesting word from a real natural language.
2. An interesting quote.
3. An interesting photo.

These prompts are simply to help you along. If you don‚Äôt want to follow them, you don‚Äôt have to. If you choose to follow the prompts, simply come up with words that could go along with it. For example, for the single word prompt, you can create a word that either relates or corresponds to the natlang‚Äôs word. For the quote, you can try translating it and adding the words that you don‚Äôt already have. For the photo, you can create words that you‚Äôd use to describe it. My goal is to make the prompts as neutral as possible so that all concultures, computers, aliens, and secret journals can benefit from them!

Some quick pointers to get the most out of your Lexember experience:

+ When you coin a new word, develop it as much as possible. Think of alternate meanings, idioms, connotations, and what it specifically does and does not refer to.
+ Put the word in an example sentence. This helps you internalize the word because you‚Äôre able to see it work in real-time. It‚Äôs also good grammar practice!
+ Save all your coined words on an external document. It is very very easy to lose your work under a pile of Reddit comments.
+ Some comments will be in-depth and detailed, others won‚Äôt be. Do whatever you can, and don‚Äôt worry about how it compares to anyone else‚Äôs. Last year, a few people followed along and expanded their lexicon, but didn‚Äôt share any of their new words in the comments. That‚Äôs okay, too!
+ With that said, read others‚Äô entries as well. Perhaps they will inspire you and expand your horizons of what you can do. This is a community activity; we should learn from each other!
+ Have fun! _Obviously_‚Ä¶

**TL;DR:** Lexember is an annual challenge to create at least one word every day in December. Our subreddit is celebrating by posting optional daily prompts to help you along with expanding your lexicon. This is not a competition, and the prompts are optional, but all top-level comments must be about the new words you have added.

Prompts begin December 1.

Happy Lexember!
