Howdy, nerds.

Stressed out by finals? Depressed from the cold weather? Busy with the holidays? Well, I’m here to lift your spirits.

If you’re new here, [r/conlangs](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/) has an annual tradition of celebrating **Lexember**. Lexember is a conlanging challenge that has been happening all over social media since around 2012. The goal of this challenge is to add at least one new lexeme to your lexicon every single day in the month of December (Lexicon + December = Lexember, get it?). Since a lot of conlangers are interested in doing it, we here at reddit dot com slash r slash conlangs have decided to stream-line and host it all in one place. Here’s how it works:

## The Format

+ Each day at 1200 UTC, we’ll publish the day’s Lexember post.
+ In the comments you can talk about your new lexeme(s), what they mean, how they’re used, where they come from, etc.
+ Each post will include some prompts as well, so if you’re stuck for ideas, we’ve got you covered. This year’s prompts will be based on linguistic concepts related to word formation and lexical semantics, so you’ll be learning some quick linguistic fun facts along the way to help you think through some of the more technical aspects of language description and creation.
+ Additionally, each day will have examples from conlangs made by people in the community! So that’s fun. (If you want to contribute to that, send me a DM either through here or \[preferably\] to Page#2000 on Discord. I still have a handful of slots to fill.)

## How to Stay Engaged

Since these prompts will be more about how you can add things to your lexicon, there won’t be much in terms of what to add to your lexicon. For the most part, that’s up to you. But, here are some ways you can easily generate some ideas:

+ Choose a theme for yourself for the whole month. For example, maybe focus on words for stuff around the house or words for different professions or different flora/fauna.
+ Follow along with [past Lexembers](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/wiki/meta/lexember). I’ll link the page that includes all of the prompts from the past three years of Lexember here. You can always check out what those prompts were and create words for those.
+ Telephone off of another user’s conlang or the conlang example in the prompt. If you’re not familiar with the [recurring Telephone game](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/search/?q=biweekly%20telephone%20game&restrict_sr=1&sr_nsfw=&sort=new), it’s when you take a word posted by someone else, then add it to your own conlang, modifying the phonetics and semantics a bit to fit what you want.
+ Translate a short text or sentence. Translating texts is, in my humble opinion, the best way to generate new vocabulary and fill in holes in your grammar. Pick a passage to translate for this month and follow along sentence by sentence!

## Rules & Guidelines

There is only one enforced rule to r/conlangs’ Lexember challenge (in addition to the other sub-wide rules, of course):

1. **All top level comments must be responses to the Lexember prompt.** This lets the creative content stay front-and-center so that others can see it. If you want to discuss the prompts themselves, there will be a pinned automod comment that you can reply to.

In addition to that one rule, here are some guidelines that won’t be enforced, but will be helpful:

1. **Count your lexemes!** At the end of Lexember, I like to go through and count how many new words we have collectively coined together (last year was 10,250). Not only will counting them be helpful for me, they’ll also help you to look back and see how much progress you’ve made. (I don’t really care how you count them.)
2. **Save your work on a separate document!** I do not want you to comb through dozens of lexember posts just to find your word for twig because I’ve done that before and it’s no fun.
3. **Be as detailed as you can!** Include IPA transcriptions, parts of speech, usage notes, cultural descriptions, etymologies, all that you can and want to fit in there. (If you don't have time/energy for anything beyond something simple, that’s also totally fine).

If you're new to conlanging and would like to learn more about lexicon-building and Lexember, check out the sub's [resources page](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/wiki/resources#wiki_5._lexicon_building) and take a peek at [past Lexembers](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/wiki/meta/lexember).

What are your plans and goals for this year’s Lexember? Tell us in the comments! (along with any questions, of course.)

Merry Conlanging!
