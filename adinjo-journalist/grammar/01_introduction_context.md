Introduction & Context of Original Adinjo
=========================================

Original Adinjo is a hypothetical member of the Adinjo language family, crafted
without guidance beyond what was needed for the sake of the author’s projects.
It began as a private journaling language, a cipher of the standard Latin
alphabet with a few private words, intended to be read as if it were English.
Over time, the scope of the project has grown beyond this limited purpose.

Original Adinjo is now being retired by the creator for use only as a reference
and journaling language, from which to acquire roots or words which are either
unavailable to his process of derivation or in cases where the Adin flavor is
better reflected by one of his original words, which cannot be reasonably
developed through derivation and phonological change. The artistic work of the
language is also freely released to the public -- any linguist wishing to modify
or derive from it is welcome to do so with my explicit blessing, for whatever
legal weight or value that may have.

Adinjo, the current name of the language family, is from a term meaning “the
peoples’ language” or “the language of all the people.”
