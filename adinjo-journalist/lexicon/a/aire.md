aire
====

**airend** _ton verb, gerund_

1. finding
2. learning
3. discovering

This verb refers to the result of self-directed actions, those actions which stem from _intrinsic motivation_ rather than those which result from _extrinsic motivation_ such as being an apprentice or a student in standard or compulsory education, or even following a map produced by someone else. Forms of **aire** are appropriate for finding a coin on the ground or discovering something one has no prior knowledge of.

`#verb` `#ton`

### Examples

> Bajia ni yi aireton

Literally "Today I am learning," this is the most appropriate way to refer to a current learning process, equivalent to the Reddit shorthand TIL meaning "Today I Learned." If abbreviated, it would drop the positional **ni** and be rendered as **BYA**.
