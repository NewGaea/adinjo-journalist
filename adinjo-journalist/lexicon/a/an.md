### Other Forms

Because Adinjo writing is phonetic, when any of the following mutations occur,
they are indicated in writing.

Preceding \<b\>, \<p\>, \<f\>, or \<v\> either of these prefices may mutate
into _**am-**_.

Either of these prefices may be represented as _**an'-**_.

Sometimes, the second prefix is formed as _**ani-**_ or _**ani'-**_.

### Derivation

Both forms of **an** are prefixes, and used regularly in derivation.

1. **an** (1) is derived from the word **[anjyu](anjyu.md)** meaning sex or gender, and can be attached to nouns or descriptors to form a class or genre label.
2. **an** (2) is the prefix form of **[ani](ani.md)** _to be_, and may be attached to any class of word to create a stative _ton_ verb equivalent to the English construction "being _x_" or "to be _x_" (for example, **anabse** would mean "being black", and can then conjugate as any _ton_ verb).

There is some thought that **anjyu** may already be a derivation using the **an-** prefix derived from **aniru**, however there is not currently a recognized word from which the **jyu** element could come except for **anjyu** itself.
