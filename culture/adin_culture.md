Adin culture varies widely, especially since the Second Empire, governed by Dani Soldorm, collapsed roughly 700 Gaean years ago. Each planet is different, some more technologically oriented and others more traditional. This is recording the Adin culture on Atrusius, as most of the other planets are not in contact with any others. The rise of the Third Empire, headed by Zeus Sonhir, is still only in progress, and only two worlds are known to be populated with Adin ready to accept the Third Empire, with a third unaware of their existence -- Humans are so selectively unaware at times.

Most of the Adin culture, regardless of technological development, is very religiously oriented. Even their schools of magic view magic as a gift of god, allowing people to manipulate the energies of the elemental universe. This image of such a benevolent deity has shaped their culture for over four-thousand years, with the greatest change occurring about two-thousand years ago.

The Adin can be divided into two, compatible, genetic groupings: [Aldjin](../lexicon/a/aldjin.md) and [Merchin](../lexicon/m/merchin.md). Old Blood and New Blood, respectively. Only five percent of the population is considered more than 50% Aldjin, however, and this number is slowly decreasing as the Merchin population grows and the Aldjin population remains relatively stable. Of course, genetically, one is either a pure blooded Aldjin, with all of the (primarily recessive) traits thereof, or else a Mercin.

Aldjin are essentially immortal, and have a <s>super-telomerase</s> and extremely rapid recuperative abilities, which allow them to look and feel as if they are anywhere from their mid 20's to somewhere in their fifties, aging at a small fraction of the human rate after they reach puberty. A small proportion of Aldjin, believed to be around 0.65%, are born neotenous, or already in this state of slow aging, looking infantile or childlike long into their life, at least until they learn to control their shape-shifting ability.

Mercin are mortal and live only around 200 years or so, though this life span is dropping (only 600 years ago the average lifespan of a new-born was 400 years, and 300 years ago it was 350 years) as generations pass. They age similarly to humans, however the process slows down around at 30-40 years of age.

## Adin Religion

The Adin have a monotheistic religion with belief in a God with a capital "G", however they are surprisingly tolerant of the beliefs of others, unlike many monotheistic religions and cultures on earth. They never attempt to force their belief on others, though they do not hide it, and are willing to help those who wish to learn their beliefs. This favorably tolerant attitude comes from their religious philosophy, that the road to God is not bound with gates, but that a just, moral, and right-minded life are more important than one’s specific beliefs.

Much like some of the more “relaxed” sects of modern Christianity, the Adin believe that religion should be a personal choice, and never impose it, even within their culture. However, due to the pervasive nature of a culture generally focused around this religion, it is probably little surprise that nearly 85% of the Adin population on Atrusius is considered to hold this religion by census.

Of the remainder, roughly 7% are reported to believe that God does exist, but they do not partake of the organized religion. Another 4% are considered "Perceptuals", who believe that all elements of life are open to be perceived and manipulated by the perceiver (they believe Man is God). 2% follow religious practices peculiar or native to Atrusius, and the remaining 2% follow no religious practices, and either doubt or disbelieve the existence of any sort of deity.

The prevalent Adin religion is very similar to Christianity, and in fact the Adin "Biblas" contains portions of both the Old and New Testaments of the Christian Bible, as well as the Adin Old Testament, recording several covenants between God and the Adin people. As the Adin Old Testament is intermixed with the Hebrew Old testament, and the Biblas is not divided into books in the same manner as the Bible, it is sometimes difficult to tell where one separates from the other.

### The Old Ways

Of course, despite its prevalence, the monotheistic religion is a relatively new invention created by Yreons the Unifier, some 3500 Gaean years ago. In the days before this, remembered by many of the scattered colonies in the cosmos and many of the Aldjin, the Adin worshipped a number of Gods in a number of ways, and had an attitude towards religious philosophy in line with syncretism – that though the philosophy of a particular dheon (a god or goddess, or sometimes a totemic spirit or powerful supernatural being) might oppose the philosophy of another, so long as the beliefs of people all worked towards a common betterment or good, they could coexist. This syncretistic attitude did prevail, in the long term, even into modern religion, as noted above.

In the ancient days, the Adin shared a small pantheon of four gods and two goddesses, and beyond them, each tribe had a varied selection of totemic spirits and giants which they revered or worshipped. The gods were given governance of the Wind, the Earth, Fires, and Lightning, while the goddesses were given the domains of the Sea and Illumination, and from them, many of the giants and spirits were blessed. It was only when Yreons of the Bear Tribe decided to unify all of the tribes under one nation and one name, and in the process, created, through adoption of the Gaean religious beliefs of Zoroastrianism and Judaism to create a monotheistic belief with a lesser evil figure.

In the modern day, the Old Ways are primarily only followed by old Aldjin families, however these families still occasionally produce shamanistic priests who serve the totemic spirits and the old dheonu. In some remote areas, even the Mercin adopt this practice under pressure from a local noble or powerful shamanic family. This practice is officially outlawed, but enforcement is scarce, as these families and individuals often pay lip service to KHIIC and declare the official state religion in public and when reporting themselves to the census. As a result, the exact percentage of the population who still observe the Old Ways is unknown, and generally considered unknowable.

## Adin Social Structure

Outside of religion, the Adin social structure is relatively straightforward and simple to understand. The first and basic level of social being is the individual, rising to the family, the circle of friends, the community, the city, and the nation. Though occasionally further divisions exist, this is the general social structure.

The basic honors of any individual are due first to their family: parents and ancestors are honored and respected highly. Old age is a symbol of experience and wisdom, and is respected by almost all Adin regardless of social status and religious beliefs. After parents and ancestors, honors are given to friends and to one’s word, and then to government of the city, nation, and empire.

## Homes and Buildings

Most Adin homes are a single floor above ground with a basement or separate building for storage; the normal Adin house’s main floor is elevated in the area of six to twelve inches above the ground. Only the moderately wealthy are likely to build or own homes with a second floor, and when they do, it is normally used as the personal floor, while the main floor remains the public floor, where all the family shares time. Meals are often served at an outdoor table when weather is good, and indoors when not. Most meals are large, and consist of meat, fruit, vegetables, and bread. Dinner usually is a salad followed by a main course of meat and bread with dessert containing fruit and dairy products.

Temples and public government buildings are built half again the height of a single-story building, often with a stonework cellar in which sacred objects may be stored, or where pilgrims among the clergy may shelter a night or two when passing through town. Temples are typically designed such that the surface of the floor is flush with the ground level, while the main floor of public government buildings is typically raised a minimum of 12 inches above the ground level, environment and terrain permitting. Temples have minimal decorative elements beyond a possibly bell-tower, clock-tower, or a bell and clock-tower.

Fortifications are generally built to twice the height of a single-story building, often with one floor at ground level, one above, and one more below. Non-military buildings built up against a fortifying wall are, by regulation, allowed to rise only to a height of one floor

## Specific Questions

### Table Manners

> **Do (the Adin) use plates and forks and all the niceties like napkins?**

`Answer as of 2022-Jun-14`
Depending on the meal and course, though usually it's easier to wash your hands than the napkins, and so a running tap or bowl of water is usually kept on hand for washing up. Napkins are reserved largely for the messiest of meals (think of barbecued ribs) or for entertaining company, or else for the higher class individuals.

Furniture in most homes is simple, a sofa and/or group of chairs for the family to relax in after a hard day of work, school (urban Adin children are schooled until 14, all education after that point is optional; rural children are schooled only until 10), or trade training (the usual follow-up to school is trade training, learning a trade to make money off of later in life), often spent by chatting about how the day went. Another common leisure project is reading books or magazines, as is tending the family garden.

### Education & Apprenticeship

> Is this a formal education or an apprenticeship? Is there a division between "professions" which are passed on via further formal education (like the Law perhaps) and "crafts" which are passed on via apprenticeship (like carpentry for example).
>
> Are there divisions within such occupations?

Localized schooling is the norm, with small community or neighborhood school groups, instead of a centralized educational committee. Children are expected to have their parents continuing lessons at home, especially encouraging the linguistic development of children, and "homework" such as we have it in some area of Earth is rare. While studies are expected to continue at home, formal homework assignments are rare outside of writing or artistic studies.

By the end of basic schooling, a youth is expected to be capable of writing rhetoric and essays as well as poetry, and to have firm reading comprehension (demonstrated through discussion and essay composition). In addition to these linguistic skills, the youth is expected to be able to perform mathematics up to the level of basic algebra and geometry, and understand fundamental concepts in the physical and life sciences including anatomy, biology, geology, and chemistry. Atop this, a very basic grounding in social areas such as history, politics, and the law is expected of the youth who has completed basic schooling. Note that these standards are for urban areas, and young people who are raised in rural areas often are less versed in linguistics, algebra, and the social knowledge of an urban youth.

After the basic schooling, more specialized training is available through more formal schooling. This usually involves those who want to pursue theology, thaumaturgy, legalistic ventures, medicine, or writing projects. The alternative is trade training and apprenticeship, which is often done with artists, musicians, and all other types of entertainers, not to mention blacksmiths, warriors, lumbersmiths, carpentry, sailing, and other more "hands on" types of work.

It's generally not hugely distinct to look at any given Adin and know much more than that they're either a manual laborer or someone with a less physically strenuous job, though the accomplished and dedicated observer can infer more than this simple division. Because travel is a dangerous affair, blacksmiths make easily as good of a living as a legalist or priest.

### Housing Differences & Basic Needs

Less wealthy families have smaller homes, smaller gardens, and smaller meals, but no Adin ever goes hungry for lack of money, and no shopkeeper on Atrusius would ever withhold food for lack of money. Running water is common, even among the poor, but most baths are public affairs (a casual exchange of services is often called 'washing backs' in reference to the casual exchange of back-washing in bath-houses), leaving home plumbing to washing food and toilets.
