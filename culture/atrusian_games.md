# Atrusian Games

With the Orks, Adin, Semerikän, and everyone else living on Atrusius, games
are critical. Sometimes games are played for fun and enjoyment, ometimes for profit, sometimes sport games are played competitively, sometimes for fun. Sometimes games are even played for marriage, or to celebrate it.

## Riddling

This is a game often played at Adin, Halfling, Elvish, and Semerikän wedding parties, where the guests and newlyweds exchange riddles and attempt to answer them, and normally the priest, cleric, or judge (or other trustworthy person) presides over scoring based on the difficulty of the riddle and clarity of the answer. It is played for fun, though the Halfling tradition claims that the top-scoring player will be the next married, or if married already it's said to bring good luck to the marriage.

## Dueling

Often used to win the heart of a lady, or to decide which of multiple suitors shall 'win' her, this is a duel of close-range combat with "by-the-book" swordplay, or other appropriate weaponry. Though this is not a common practice for marriage in Adin culture, every other culture uses some form of combat to decide on worthy mates for the women -- The Gramurn and Hol'tiin have a form of combat against the woman, initiated when she is prepared to choose a mate, while Orks, Elves, and the Semerikan all duel amongst themselves to show strength for, or to, their women.

Dueling is also a common way of settling scores and debts, and even personal insults. Most such duels are held privately, and generally to three drawings of blood to either competitor. Sometimes, however, a duel may be issued 'to pain or death', in which terms the loser lives with a permanent and obvious scar as well as the humiliation of defeat, or else dies in combat. Occasionally timed duels are used, between commanders during battles, to determine a victor. Whichever is closer to the blow limit (number of blows taken before loss) loses the duel when time runs out, although death or surrender can both be alternative solutions. Under a draw, the challenger is considered to have been bested.

## Rune Chips

The Semerikän have an age-old game played with stone or clay blocks shaped like a pentagon. These rune chips are also used in fortune telling.

These chips are marked with an element (fire, water, earth, and wind) rune and a numeric value, or with more recent ones the element is indicated by color dyes on the blocks. These can be used to simulate the majority of card games, but are often used in high stakes games of honor and chance. The traditional game of rune chips is similar to a cross between Mah Johng and Go Fish, while a strategy form called 'One' is played, in which two or more players attempt to reduce the value of their hand to a 1 or less through elemental and numerical values. When this goal is achieved they declare a 'One-hand' and show their tiles to the opponents. In spite of the goal, there is a minimum of three rounds before any player can declare a 'One-hand', to prevent cheating and to keep the game interesting. Some variants use a Trump in which the Element bid is of double value, the opposition Element is worth half (with a minimum value of 1), and the other two are of their basic values.

## Strike

This Orkish game is preparation for combat, hunting, and raiding, and is also a common practice during courtship. During Strike, the goal is to strike your opponent with a Worgulbyr (Worg Stick) until he surrenders or is rendered incapable of fighting, generally by being knocked unconscious. Because of the nature of the Worgulbyr, however, serious injuries can also cause an opponent to be declared incapable of battle.

The Worgulbyr is a staff which has a 'cap' on one end which covers a finely sharpened and smoothed blade during most times. There are handguards both at the bottom of the blade and towards the other end of the staff, and the top end is curved in a fashion similar to anything from a human hockey stick to a shepherds crook.

Worgulbyr are also used in 'Cross' and a number of ritual ceremonies.

## Cross

This Orkish game is similar to human soccer and basketball, with elements of lacrosse. A stiff net is fastened to the top end of each player's Worgulbyr, and is used to either focus and deflect or to catch a leather-covered ball of sand. The field is roughly 60 yards in length and 30 in width, and at either end is a goal, towards which the ball is being directed by players. While it is in the air, no player may touch it with his hands, but if it touches the ground, it may remain on the ground being kicked, or it may be carried by hand and aimed for either of two rings, which are located at the
center of the field's length, but the edges of its width.

Any shot scored by stick against the opposing goalie is worth 3 points, any shot by kick against him is worth 2. All shots in the rings are worth 1 point. The blade of a Worgulbyr is never used during Cross, and any player who uses it is subject to a penalty, from being forced to sit out to the forced forfeit of his team.
