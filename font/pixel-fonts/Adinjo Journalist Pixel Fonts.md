![[SHANDAI-8.2.png]]

This is an 8 pixel tall font designed for use on UI badges in the GameBoy Advance Pokémon games, such as the type badges displayed on Pokémon stat screens or in the Pokédex. While the original Latin script font was 5x8 or narrower, SHANDAI allows certain characters to be 6 pixels wide.

When composed, the glyphs should have no breaking between adjacent letterforms, only punctuation or manual spacing should leave space between glyphs. At present, Shandai does not include diacritics, punctuation, or any other special characters.
