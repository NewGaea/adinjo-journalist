Phonology and Phonotactics of Original Adinjo
=============================================

Consonants
----------

The consonants of Original Adinjo are as follows:



```
            Labial      Coronal        Dorsal Rear
Nasal         m            n             ng
Stop         p  b        t  d         k kw g  ʔ
Affricate    f  v       ts  dz tʃ  dʒ   ks
Fricative          θ  ð  s  z  ʃ   ʒ  x       h
Approximant   w      r  l          j
```

This is essentially what could be called the Standard Fantasy Phonology, and it
is not an inaccurate description. Original Adinjo is the author’s first conlang
project, and dawned with an ignorance of linguistics and a minimal knowledge of
languages outside of English.

Original Adinjo may be written in any Adin Alphabet or in standard Latin script
based on English orthography.

### Nasals ###

The nasals may be pronounced as they would in midwestern American English (the
author was raised and lives in Michigan, so a Michigan accent would reflect his
own speech patterns). As in English, the nasal /ng/ may not occur in a
word-initial position. The nasals are written as they are presented in the table
above.

### Stops and Variation ###

The primary stops are independent phonemes, though they may be labialized or
pronounced as digraphs if found in [S]w digraphs, and palatalized or pronounced
as digraphs in [S]y digraphs. The stops in the above chart are all pronounced as
the sounds they represent in IPA notation.

Of note, **\<q\>** represents the digraph [kw] and may be pronounced as either
[kw] or [kʷ]. This is the only labialized stop with a unique representation in
the Adin writing, and in Adinjo the letter **\<q\>** need not be followed by
**\<u\>** to be pronounced in this manner.

### Affricates ###

The affricates of Adinjo are pronounced largely as their notation in IPA would
suggest, though they are not all notated in the romanized orthography as they
appear above. The orthographic notations are listed here:

- **\<c\>** represents the affricate [ts], and becomes [tʃ] when written as the
  digraph **\<ch\>** or as the character **\<ç\>**. _Originally, **\<c\>**
  represented only [tʃ], and some words are best read with this in mind._
- **\<j\>** represents the fricative [ʒ], but becomes the affricate [dʒ] when
  written as the digraph dj. _Originally, **\<j\>** represented only [dʒ], and
  some words which begin with j are best read with this in mind._

### Fricatives ###

The fricatives of Original Adinjo are pronounced largely as would be expected
from the table above, though several are written as digraphs or with a character
not normal to English usage:

- **\<th\>** represents the dental [θ]
- **\<dh\>** represents the dental [ð]
- **\<sh\>** is the post-alveolar [ʃ]
- **\<j\>** is the post-alveolar [ʒ]

### Other Consonants ###

- **\<w\>** and **\<y\>** are semi-vowels; a consonant followed by /y/ is
  palatalized, while a consonant preceded by /y/ has a short [ɪ]. Though there
  are no known words which use /w/ followed by a consonant, such words would
  contain a short [ʌ].
- **\<x\>** represents both the velar and uvular fricatives, which are
  allophonic in Adinjo.
  - **\<x\>** can be allophonic with both **\<h\>** and **\<k\>**, and is
    always allophonic with **\<ɣ\>** and **\<ʁ\>**, since Adinjo does note
    have a vocal distinction in these positions.
- **\<h\>** is always a clear sound - it is never silent.
- **\<r\>** is an alveolar, though it may be accurately realized as any of an
  approximant, a flap, or a fricative.

### Vowels ###

The vowels of Proto-Adinjo are:

```
        Front Back
Open     í i   ú
         é e  u ó
Close    á a   o
```

- **\<a\>** is pronounced [ä]; **\<á\>** is pronounced [æ].
- **\<e\>** is pronounced [ɛ]; **\<é\>** is pronounced [e].
- **\<i\>** is pronounced [ɪ]; **\<í\>** is pronouced [i].
- **\<o\>** is pronounced [ɔ]; **\<ó\>** is pronounced [o].
- **\<u\>** is pronounced [ʌ]; **\<ú\>** is pronounced [u].

Any vowel with a grave accent (_blut_ marker) ignores the normal stress rules
of the word and is pronounced in its _natural_ or _unmarked_ state.

### Diphthongization ###

In Adinjo, diphthongs are long vowel sounds that blend together.

- **\<ai\>** is pronounced as [aɪ]
- **\<au\>** is pronounced as [au]
- **\<ei\>** is pronounced as [eɪ]
- **\<eu\>** is pronounced as [ef] or [ev] based on the voicing of the next
  sound
- **\<ou\>** is pronounced as [ou]
- **\<ui\>** is pronounced as [ʌɪ]

Stressed diphthongs stress the offset vowel, never the onset. Note also that the
diphtong **\<eu\>**, because its offset is a fricative consonant, cannot be
stressed, and is ignored as a vowel in choosing the stress pattern of a word.

### Stress ###

Stress occurs by tensing (usually also raising) the tone of the first syllable
containing certain vowels, in order of priority. This tensing causes the vowel
to be pronounced as it's _asent_ marked counterpart, though it is overridden by
explicit accent markings, and is the only way **\<a\>** can be stressed.

#### Explicit Stress Markers ####

1. If the word has an _asent_ mark anywhere in it (acute accent), the first
   _asent_ receives primary stress, and every other _asent_ vowel receives
   secondary stress.
2. The _blut_ vowel marker indicates that this vowel is unstressed regardless
   of any other rules.

#### Natural Stress Pattern ####

1. Prefixed syllables are ignored unless they contain an _asent_ marker.
2. Stress never falls on any syllable with **\<a\>** unless explicitly marked.
3. The first syllable with **\<i\>** or any diphthong receives primary stress.
4. If the previous rule is not met, primary stress falls on the first syllable
   (after the first) with **\<u\>**, **\<e\>**, or **\<o\>** in that order.
5. Secondary stress falls on the second syllable after the primary stress, and
   on every third syllable after that.

#### Examples ####

- **\<_ic_\>** is one syllable, and because it contains **\<i\>** is stressed,
  and thus pronounced [its:]
- **\<_poren_\>** is two syllables, and because it contains no **\<i\>** the
  primary stress is placed on the second syllable, thus pronounced [po rɛn:].
- **\<_jedai_\>** is two syllables, and the second syllable contains the
  diphthong **\<ai\>**. The primary stress is on the second syllable [ʒɛ däi:]
- **\<_kashontax_\>** is three syllables, and has no **\<i\>**, **\<e\>**, or
  **\<u\>**. This means the primary stress falls on the second syllable, and the
  word is pronounced [kä ʃon: täx]

### Other Phonological Processes ###

#### Palatalization ####

When followed by **\<i\>** or **\<y\>**, the letter **\<c\>** becomes
palatalized to **\<ç\>**.

When followed by **\<y\>**, the letter **\<j\>** is always read as \[ʒ\], even
if it is part of a **\<dj\>** digraph.

#### Glottalization ####

Written as **\<'\>**, the glottal stop between any two letters indicates a
syllabic break, even if the two letters would normally form a digraph.
