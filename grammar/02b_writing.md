Writing Systems for Adinjo
==========================

## Native Script

Adinjo Journalist has a native alphabetic script called the _adobat_. This script has gone through several revisions over the years.

### Alphabet

Adinjo Journalist has 26 letters (_dakmelu_) and the _adobat_ is ordered loosely as in Ancient Greek. Most of these letters correspond to sounds present in modern English.

## Romanization

When writing Adinjo Journalist in latin script, three orthographies are available.

### Simple Romanization

Simple romanization attempts to make Adinjo as legible to a typical English language speaker as possible, using digraphs to more precisely indicate sounds which might contrast with their intuitive expectations.

Simple romanization is idea for use in projects which are likely to see the public, as it helps to make them easier to read in an accurate manner.

### Formal Romanization

Formal romanization is the standard used throughout this documentation, using one-to-one romanization for every letter, and allowing several digraphs to have a single letter as well.

Formal romanization is ideal for any formal usage like translation projects, as it maintains consistency and clarity by minimizing the chance of misreading a digraph.

### IPA Romanization

IPA romanization is the most precise form of romanization, and is used for broad phonetic transcription of words and phrases. IPA romanization should be used with stress patterns already included, particularly as relates to vowel stress.

IPA romanization is ideal for precise usage, such as glosses, poetry (which may not always follow standard rules of speech or writing), and scripts intended for recording.

In addition to the above individual letters, Adinjo has several digraphs which represent single phonemes. These can be written as follows:

| Letter Names  | Simple | Formal | IPA    |
|:--------------|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| adob + iom    | ai     | ai     | äɪ     |
| adob + unta   | au, ow | au     | äu     |
| drom + hort   | dh     | ð      | ð      |
| drom + jema   | j      | dj     | dʒ     |
| enx + iom     | ei     | ei     | ɛɪ     |
| enx + unta    | ef, ev | eu     | ɛf, ɛv |
| cumit + hort  | ch     | ç      | tʃ     |
| cumit + iom   | chi    | çi     | tʃɪ    |
| cumit + yast  | ch     | ç      | tʃ     |
| swen + hort   | sh     | ʃ      | ʃ      |
| tar + hort    | th     | θ      | θ      |
| unta + iom    | ui     | ui     | ʌɪ     |
| omoj + unta   | oh     | ou     | ou     |

An apostrophe indicates that a syllable break is forced, whether as a glottal stop or simple distinction between two letters, and is particularly important to indicate when two letters do _not_ form a digraph. Of particular note, the _Simple Romanization_ method requires an apostrophe any time Adinjo Journalist uses the combination of _kasi + hort_, as _kh_ is the Simple form for Romanizing _xoi_.
