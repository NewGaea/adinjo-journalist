# Verbal Morphology

Adinjo has 3 tenses, 5 voices, and 3 aspects. In addition to this, there are two primary paradigms of verbs: **ton** and **kun** verbs, each named for a distinctive suffix.

## TON Verbs

The vast majority of verbs in Adinjo are TON verbs, named for the present tense suffix common to them. Adin linguists prefer the term **_taru votenu_** ('_t verbs_'), because the suffix for this class of verbs will always begine with the /**t**/ sound, unless it is assimilating to /**d**/ after a voiced stop. In common speech, they are often called **_kijuçinu votenu_** (_regular verbs_), because they are the most common form in the language.

TON verbs are regular in that (**a**) they rarely, if ever, change the verb stem when they are applied, (**b**) they all share the initial /to/ sound in their conjugation, and (**c**) they always apply the negative after the tense (and voice) is formed. However, there is no consistent rule for forming the gerund of a TON verb, thus TON verbs are listed (lemmatized) in the dictionary in their gerund form, though the lexicon pages begin with the stem rather than the lemma.

The basic suffixes are -**_tot_** for the past tense, -**_ton_** for the present, and -**_toçi_** for the future. To make these forms active, the infix -**_ol_**- is added after the initial /**_t_**/ of the basic tense suffixes, except that the present active is simply -**_tol_** (the /**_on_**/ of the passive is dropped). To form the negative, add the suffix -**_ha_** to future tense (and any other form ending in a vowel), or -**_a_** to the past and present tenses (and any other form ending in a consonant). The initial /t/ of the TON verb suffixes will assimilate the voicing of a root-final stop, becoming /d/ if the last sound in the stem is /b/, /d/, /dh/ or /g/ (and also replacing that consonant), and will be dropped after /t/, /c/ or /d/.

## KUN Verbs

KUN verbs are named for the distinctive future tense suffix -**_ykun_**. KUN verbs do not distinguish active and passive voices, and their dictionary form is the infinitive, not the gerund. The majority of KUN verbs are simple verbs, including the copula (ic 'to be'), and are used often -- it is theorized that KUN verbs were retained because of their regular use, while other paradigms were being simplified by use into the TON verb system.

KUN verbs do have one distinction, however: they conjugate differently if they end in a _consonant_ or a _vowel_. The basic suffixes are -ns for the past, -s for the present, and -ykun for the future. The infix -y(a)- may replace the final vowel in the root to indicate the negative voice. The infix -no- may be added after the first vowel, even if it breaks a diphthong, to form the gerund.

In consonant-final words, past /**_ns_**/ replaces the final consonant, thus _ic_ → _ins_. Present -**_s_** will assimilate the voicing of the consonant before it, becoming -**_z_** after voiced consonants, but follows the consonant. If the verb ends in /**s**/, /**z**/, or /**c**/, the infinitive and present tense are identical. Future -**_ykun_** is phonetically /**ʲkun**/, applying palatalization between the final consonant and vowel of the root. Negative -**_ya_**- is phonetically similar, it represents /**ʲa**/, meaning the final consonant is palatalized.

In vowel-final words, past /**_ns_**/ follows the final vowel. Present -**_c_** has voicing harmony with the first consonant in the root (thus becoming /_dz_/ if the word begins with a voiced consonant). The /**ʲ**/ element of future -**_ykun_** is dropped entirely from vowel-final words (though _ic_ is a distinct exception). Neither the negative -**_ya_**- nor the gerund -**_no_**- change based on the end of the word.

## Primary Verb Forms

### Tense and Voice

There are three tenses, past, present, and future in Adinjo, along with five primary voices which modify the basic shape of the verb. The voices are the gerund, the infinitive, the passive, the active, and the negative. The negative is a special voice which can merge with any of the others as a final suffix.

Voices in Adinjo are ways in which one can discuss or refer to an action.

| Negative    | folre                                     |

### Gerund Voice

The gerund voice is used to discuss an action as a discrete event, as if it were a noun. The root may be declined as if it were a noun in this form, but it is still considered a verb for the purpose of clause ordering: a gerund voice verb must occur at the end of a noun phrase if it is part of one. Because there is no regular rule for gerund formation among TON verbs, each verb is learned in both gerund and infinitive forms, and listed in dictionaries in the gerund form, with a full-stop marker between the root and the gerund suffix.

|:---|:---------|:----------|:--------------|
| çi | yugi-nu  | ejis      | faile-ton     |
| 2S | thing-PL | chase.GER | love-PRES.ACT |
_You love chasing things._

____

|    |      |           |                |
|:---|:-----|:----------|:---------------|
| ki | ba   | yanis     | novra-t-ol-ot  |
| 1P | this | talk.GER  | need.PAST-PASS |
_We needed (to have) this talk._

#### Infinitive Voice

The infinitive voice allows discussion of an action as an action that is performed rather than an event. It is the basic root, minus the gerund voice suffix, and is the basis of all other forms. It is semantically equivalent to the English construction _to x_, though the “to” aspect is lost when it enters any sort of conjugated form.

#### Passive and Active Voice

The natural voicing for verbs is active, or discussing them as things which are performed _by_ the subject of a sentence, and they may inflect with the -ol- inffix to become passive. Though this is strictly used in formal writing, attitudes among native Adinjo speakers are much more relaxed, and they will often allow context to clarify whether they are speaking in active or passive voice.

|     |     |                |
|:----|:----|:---------------|
| fi  | lai | faile-ton      |
| 3SF | 3SD | love-PRES.ACT |
_She loves lai._

|     |    |               |
|:----|:---|:--------------|
| ji  | yi | faile-t-ol-ot |
| 3SM | 1S | love-PAST.PASS |
_He was loved by me._

#### Negative Voice

The negative voice indicates that a verb is not performed in the given context - it might be compared to english _not_ as in "I do not run," or "I am not running." The negative infinitive is thus _to not verb_. The negative voice suffix may be attached to the end of a fully conjugated verb to negate the entire statement, or to a particular affix within the verb construction to negate only that aspect.

| ki  | ku-ci  | kendan | jan-baci-tochi-ha     |
| 1PL | GEN.2P | story  | again-see-FUT-ACT-NEG |
_We will not review your story._

### Aspect

Adinjo can express various aspects on verbs: It can express perfective, permissive, potentive, qualitative, and other aspects. Most aspects are realized as a suffix added after the tense and voice suffixes, though the order in which these aspects are appended is generally free. They may occur before or after the negative voice suffix, and they do not vary between TON and KUN verbs.

|                | Suffix | Summary |
|:---------------|:-------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Perfective** | -el    | an action which is viewed as completable or completed                                   |
| **Permissive** | -galm  | ‘may’, ‘might’, ‘is allowed to’                                                         |
| **Potentive**  | -mer   | ‘can’, ‘is able to’                                                                     |
| **Positive**   | -rin   | ‘well’, ‘thorough’, ‘completely’                                                        |
| **Negative**   | -intas | ‘poorly’, ‘unseemly’, ‘unacceptably’                                                    |
| **Amplifiers** | -dul   | ‘more’ intensifies the qualitative to which it is  suffixed, improving the quality      |
|                | -dyur  | ‘most’                                                                                  |
| **Reducers**   | -mor   | 'less' reduces the qualitative to which it is  suffixed, partially negating the quality |
|                | -grat  | ‘least’                                                                                 |

#### Perfective

The perfective indicates an action which is viewed with a completable aspect (infinitive and gerund), and which the speaker has completed (past), is in the process of completing (present), or has a mental commitment or desire to complete (future).

In the active voice, the -el suffix may be positioned as the passive voice infix _-ol-_, or used as a normal suffix before any other aspect or mood.

|    |      |                    |
|:---|:-----|:-------------------|
| yi | twa  | anis-tot-el        |
| 1P | book | read.PAST-ACT.PERF |
_I read all of (a/the) book._

|       |                       |
|:------|:----------------------|
| ten   | lixa-t-ol-ot-el       |
| sword | create.PAST-PASS.PERF |
_The sword was created._

#### Permissive

The permissive indicates that the subject of the statement is allowed, in some way, to perform the action. This allowance can range from legal authorization to divine right, and can also express a non-committed potential, as in the English, "I might clean the house this weekend." There is a strong distinction in meaning between passive and active permissive verbs, as well. Compare the following examples:

|              |        |                      |
|:-------------|:-------|:---------------------|
| ROMAN-neim   | harudj | leka-t-ol-on'galm    |
| Roman.knight | enemy  | fight.PRES-PASS.PERM |
_Sir Roman has authority to engage the enemy in battle._

|              |        |                     |
|:-------------|:-------|:--------------------|
| ROMAN-neim   | harudj | leka-ton'galm       |
| Roman.knight | enemy  | fight.PRES-ACT.PERM |
_Sir Roman has authority to assault the enemy._

Notice how the passive suggests that he can engage if attacked, but not that he may order or start an attack. The active suggests his authority includes pressing or initiating the attack. Most verbs in Adinjo will have a similar division of meaning when the permissive aspect is present, even if their passive/active distinction is less pronounced.

#### Potentive

The potentive indicates the ability, skill, or talent to perform an action. This can be combined with the negative to express a lack of ability, or with qualitative components to indicate degree of ability. The potentive always causes the verb to be treated as active, even if the passive infix -ol- is present in the verb construction.

|     |                         |
|:----|:------------------------|
| LOR | leka-ton'mer'ha         |
| Lor | fight.PRES-ACT.POT.NEG  |
_Lor cannot fight._

|     |                         |
|:----|:------------------------|
| BAL | yani-t-ol-on'mer        |
| Bal | speak.PRES-PASS.POT     |
_Bal can speak._

Note that the potentive does not always suggest an ability to act, so much as it does a potential in performance of acting. The negative example could indicate that Lor is either a coward (who does not fight), or is incompetent. If Lor is forbidden to fight, one would use the negative permissive rather than the potentive. Likewise, the positive example only indicates that Bal has the ability to speak, or that he is capable of speaking well enough to take note, it does not mean he has permission (this would be the permissive aspect) or that he is speaking, or even that his current situation is conducive to speaking.

#### Qualitatives

In Adinjo, it is possible to qualify the quality with which a verb is performed. For example, something may be done thoroughly or poorly in English, but Adinjo simply suffixes the verb. The basic qualities are the positive quality rin and the negative quality intas.

|              |                     |
|:-------------|:--------------------|
| ROMAN-neim   | leka-t-ol-on'rin    |
| Roman.knight | fight.PAST-ACT.POSQ |
_Sir Roman fought well._

|     |                      |
|:----|:---------------------|
| LOR | qonti-t-ol-ochi'ntas |
| Lor | write.FUT-ACT.NEGQ   |
_Lor will write poorly._

#### Qualitative Modifiers

On top of the qualitatives, you can compare multiple people within a category by attaching modifiers to the qualitative. The positive modifiers are _dul_ (more) and _dyur_ (most), and intensify the qualitative, indicating more extreme values on that side of the quality. On the opposite side, the negative modifiers are _mor_ (less) and _grat_ (least), which diminish the qualitative, indicate less extreme values.

|:----|:---------|:-----------------------|
| ki  | blamed.u | burme-tochi'rin'dyur   |
| 1PL | brick.PL | cook.FUT-ACT.POSQ.MOST |
_We will cook bricks completely. (literally: "will cook most well")_
