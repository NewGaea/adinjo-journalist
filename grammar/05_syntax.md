### Simple Sentences ###

The fundamental syntax of Original Adinjo, in its final state, is SOV, though it's early state was SVO. While you may run across examples of early Original Adinjo, these can be read largely as if they were English.

The simplest sentences in Adinjo are a subject or object and a verb:

```
yi   yanitot
1S   speak.PASTPASS
I said.
```
```
ji    loftoçi
3SM   defeat.FUTPASS
He will be beaten.
```
```
ROMAN   qontolon
Roman   say.PRESACT
Roman says.
```
```
dur      xampeton
flower   fall.PRESPASS
The flower is wilting.
```

Slightly more advanced are sentences with both a subject and object. As Adinjo does not distinguish between the actor and the recipient of action, there is no marking for case. A sentence with subject and object can be as simple three words.

```
yi  ci  faileton
1S  2S  love.PRESPASS
You love me.

ji  shi lofketoçi
3SM 3SF defeat.FUTPASS
He will be defeated by her.
```

### Compound Sentences ###

Sentences must always answer two questions:

#### 1. What is happening in the statement? ####

Every sentence or statement requires a verb. The verb clause typically forms the end of a statement, with most other information coming in before it.

#### 2a. To whom is this happening? ####

The simplest forms of verbs are passive, meaning they refer to a patient or object of the action. Most simple sentences are worded with the simpler passive verb forms, though in casual speech there is often little distinction between the voices for simple sentences with only one noun.

#### 2b. Who is doing this? ####

Formal speech and writing tend to be more demanding about structure and voice than casual contexts.

Any other information is optional, but it tends to build up. Note that, as shown above, sometimes an agent or patient can be omitted due to context.

#### 3. To What was it Done? ####

The object goes after the subject and before the verb. When only one noun phrase occurs in this position, it is always the _direct object_. The direct object is the thing directly affected by the action at the heart of the phrase.

```
ji    twa    qonitolon
3SM   book   write.PRESPASS
He writes a book.
```

If two noun phrases exist here, the second is the _indirect object_.

```
JEN   twa    ROMAN'hem   banctolochi
Jen   book   Roman-to    give.FUTACT
Jen will give the book to Roman.
```

To embed more than two indirect objects in a sentence, opposing directional markers may be used.

```
ROMAN'neim     orind'twa   JEN'tak    AREN'hem   banctolochi.
Roman-knight   gold-book   Jen-from   Aren-to    give.FUTACT
Roman will give the ledger from Jen to Aren.
```

You may also use a subordinate clause, by introducing an indefinite conjunction such as _what_, _which_, or _who_, before the name of subordinate clausal noun. The same sentence can be presented as follows.

```
ROMAN'neim     orind'twa,   ira     JEN'tak    bancels,   AREN'hem   banctolochi.
Roman-knight   gold-book    which   Jen-from   give.GER   Aren-to    give.FUTACT
Roman will give the ledger, which Jen gave (to him), to Aren.
```

In a subordinate clause, you do not need to re-introduce old materials except by pronoun reference. The non-subordinated version has the same semantic value, though, and is more often used in speech.

#### When and Where did it Happen? ####

The most common subordinate clauses in Adinjo are those of time and place. Time clauses precede the noun phrase which they describe:

```
6E41   nyoré  ni   JENESIS   jocotolot.
6E41   year   in   Jenesis   adventure.PASTACT.
In (the) year 6E41, Jenesis went adventuring.
```

Place clauses, however, follow the noun clause.

```
JENESIS   JAPAN   ni   jocotolot.
Jenesis   Japan   in   adventure.PASTACT
Jenesis went adventuring in Japan.
```

If both clauses are necessary, they simply surround their respective noun phrase.

```
Bacochi   toshi   nonke      dai   ellorec.
Tonight   snow    mountain   on    shines.
Tonight, the snow on the mountain shines.
```
