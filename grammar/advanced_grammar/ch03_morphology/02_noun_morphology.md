## Gender

The original Adinjo language does not have a formal gender system, such that verbs, descriptors, or most other parts of speech must agree with the gender of a word. It only has a semantic gender system, in which words have a semantic gender relating to their physical (or metaphysical) sex. In such cases, Adinjo recognizes five genders: masculine, feminine, dual, neuter/unknown, and genderless/inanimate. This most prominently shows in the series of pronouns, but words such as _[çin](lexicon/c/chin)_ ‘younger brother’, _kada_ ‘younger sister’, _medra_ ‘mother’, and _poren_ ‘father’ are semantically gendered and must be matched to pronouns of the appropriate gender.

Pronominal gender matching and respect are the only areas in which the gender system matters to speakers of Adinjo. It is considered rude to refer to an individual by the incorrect gender, unless the referent used is the neuter/unknown gender pronoun.

### Explicit Gendering

Adinjo Journalist contains a number of gendered words which provide suffixes that may be used to assign an explicit gender to any word, regardless of its normal gender (or lack thereof). This process is illustrated below using the word jubaçi ‘lion’ which does not have a semantic gender. First, you add the gender suffix for the intended gender. Second, you apply any palatalization or labialization based on the diphthongs in the new form. Third, you apply appropriate phonological processes to any consonant clusters. For example, jubaçi has the property of assibilating its final /ci/ to /ç/ before the suffixes beginning with vowels, /cd/ assimilated to a geminate /d/, and /cl/ assimilates to /l/:

| Gender     | Root   | Root Word         | Suffix  | Composed Word |
|:-----------|:------:|:-----------------:|:-------:|--------------:|
| Masculine  | jubaçi | ken ‘son’         |-en      |jubaçen (male lion) |
| Feminine   | jubaçi | daiti ‘daughter’  |-(d)aiti |jubadaiti (lioness) |
| Dual       | jubaçi | lai (dual-gender) |-lai     |jubalai (intersex lion) |
| Unknown    | jubaçi | gent ‘child’      |-ent     |jubaçent (lion) |
| Genderless | jubaçi | kon ‘metal’       |-on      |jubaçon (genderless lion) |

Over time, the gender system in Adinjo has become a relic. As there is no form of agreement to gender except in the use of pronouns, and because the universal case of non-gendered nouns matches any pronoun, there is no explicit need to use it, and the use of explicitly gendered terms is largely a matter of social understanding and refers to preferred or apparent gender of an individual.

#### Masculine & Feminine Gender

The masculine gender is used to refer to male persons or creatures, or those in socially masculine or manly roles. Physically, this means the common sex which does not bear young. Socially, this means people who are or behave in a masculine manner, including the typical case of initiating courtship rituals.

In turn, the feminine is used to refer to explicitly female persons or creatures. Contrasting with the masculine, the feminine is scientifically the child-bearing (or egg-laying) gender. Socially, the feminine indicates people who engage in feminine behaviours, though among the Adin this set of behaviours includes medical services, brewing of alcohol and potions, and sales.

This can lead to cases, in homosexual relationships, in which the masculine and feminine apply to people who are not of that physical gender. A _failen_ and _failaiti_ are not necessarily male and female, though the typical translations of them would be 'boyfriend' and 'girlfriend.'

##### Dual Gender

Historically, the Adin were once a race of reproductively-viable intersex humans. A moderately small, but significant, portion of modern Adin are still born as reproductively-viable intersex individuals, and the Adin see nothing unusual about this, or such people opting to choose any social roles. Scientifically, the dual gender refers to an individual which can fulfill both male and female roles in reproduction.

Socially, dual gender is used to refer to abstract or intangible entities -- most gods in Adin society are treated as dual gender, and the personification of normally inanimate objects is widely promoted to the dual gender.

#### Unknown Gender

The Adin on Atrusius are not comfortable with labeling the unknown -- except as unknown. When they encounter species or entities which do not fit into their gender system, they use the unknown gender to refer to it. The root word for the unknown is a child -- while a child has biology, which can be known, it is a new life, and the relationship between new life forms and children is strong among the Adin.

Unknown is not exactly the same as neuter, and is one of the few modern gender classes not inherited from past forms of the language.

#### Genderless (Neuter)

Genderless objects are neither people nor creatures, or they are creatures without any sex. Most sexless creatures, which are socially recognized as creatures, end up with the dual gender, meaning that the genderless is mostly used in scientific uses, and for inanimate objects. Even if an object is magically or otherwise granted intelligence, it is usually referred to as genderless.

## Articles

The definite article is the word sug while the indefinite article is dan. These words are placed prior to the noun they modify. The following word is interpreted as a noun, regardless of its normal class.

sug nyore ‘the year’

dan neim ‘a knight’

dan enmis ‘a loss’

These articles are strictly optional in Adinjo, and may be left out, especially when context makes clear what is meant. They are often found in poetry and legal use, however, to be certain there is no ambiguity, but in casual writing and speech, they are rarely used.

## Number

Nouns may exist in singular, plural, mass, or mass plural forms. These are formed as follows. Where there are (), said sound is used when the word the suffix attaches to ends in a vowel. Only in the case of a word that ends in a consonant will the singular animate, inanimate, & plural animate join to the coda. Otherwise they are their own syllables. The singular form is unmarked.

| **Number**      | **Affix**   | **Form**                       |
|:-----------:|:-------:|:---------------------------|
| **Singular**    | \*_-Ø_     | _dyn_ ‘person’               |
| **Plural**      | \*_-(n)u_  | _dynu_ ‘persons’, ‘people’   |
| **Mass**        | _a-_\*     | _adin_ ‘the people’          |
| **Mass Plural** | _a-\*-nu_  | _adinu_ ‘the peoples’        |

## Case

There are three cases in Adinjo: the Simple, the Genitive, and the Negative. Where there are (), said sound is used when the word the affix attaches to contains a vowel adjacent to the affix. 

| **Case**      | **Suffix**  | **Sample Word**       |
|:----------|:-------:|:------------------|
| **Simple**    | _\*-Ø_     | _partwa_ ‘letter’   |
| **Genitive**  | _ku(‘)-\*_ | _kubajia_ ‘today’s’ |
| **Negative**  | _\*-(h)a_  | _kenga_ ‘bald’      |

### Simple

The simple case is unmarked and is the default form of most words. It is used for all cases not specifically discussed below.

### Genitive

The genitive case indicate ownership or creation of an object, possession of a quality, or loyalty to an idea or place. For example, John’s dog, Faith’s beauty, or Leonardo da Vinci. The genitive attaches to the owner, creator, possessor, or place of origin, and the following noun phrase is the owned.

ex: kuROMAN partwa JURIN-hem enmis.

GEN-Roman letter Jurin-DIR.to lost.PASS.PRES

Roman’s letter to Jurin is lost.

##### Negative

The negative case indicates that a noun is not present, is incorrect, or is false in the current situation. The negative case may, in some situations, cause a noun to become an adjective, or a verb, and is comparable to the negative mood on a verb, which shares the same construction.

  

ex: sug partwa dekcina.

DEF letter word-NEG

The letter has no words.

#### Identifiers

Identifiers include the articles mentioned above, and any other word use to specify an individual out of a group (or a sub-group out of a group). These can be Descriptors (see below) or semi-proper nouns -- such words include the names of races or ethnic groups, which are treated as proper nouns grammatically, but not in how they are written.

Identifiers (unless they are proper nouns) are written in text as if they were normal words, though they may optionally begin with a single capital letter, similar to the way German marks all nouns.

##### Proper Nouns

Proper Nouns are the specific names of individuals, locations, or things. They are equivalent to personal names, and while they are not marked in any special way when spoken, in writing all PROPER NOUNS are written entirely in majuscule script. Names are discussed in a later section of this grammar, and are written largely by English standards.

Some examples have already shown the practice of Adin text fully capitalizing proper names -- and not capitalizing any affixes to them. The use of majuscule or capital lettering is meant to highlight and draw attention to the proper nouns.
