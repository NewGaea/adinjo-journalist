# Pronouns

A pronoun stands in for a noun or noun phrase. They can largely be divided into two categories in Adinjo: personal pronouns and referential pronouns.

## Personal Pronouns

**Personal pronouns** refer to people or personal entities. The only words which have any level of gender agreement in Adinjo are the personal pronouns, as the third person pronouns are gendered, and must agree with the gender of their referent.

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **First (1)** | _yi_ (I, me) | _ki_ (we, us) |
| **Second (2)** | _ci_ (you) | _cinu_ (you all) |
| **Third, Masc. (3M)** | _ji_ (he, him) | _jinu_ (they, them) |
| **Third, Fem. (3F)** | _fi_ (she, her) | _finu_ (they, them) |
| **Third, Neut. (3N)** | _shi_ (they, them) | _shinu_ (they, them) |
| **Third, Unknown (3U)** | _xi_ (they, them) | _xinu_ (they, them) |
| **Third, Dual (3D)** | _lai_ (shi, hir) | _lainu_ (shis, hirs) |
| **Fourth (4)** | _on, win_ (one) | _onu, winu_ (ones, those) |

In most cases, you will only need to know the masculine, feminine, and neutral forms of the third person pronoun. The fourth person is a way to refer to a person in general who has no particular identity, as in the case of writing rules or laws. In the event you find need to use a fourth person, the preferred forms in conversation are _on, onu._

## Referential Pronouns

Referential pronouns are pronouns that refer to things which are not treated as people. They may refer to a place or point in time, an inanimate object, or an impersonal abstract concept. These also include the oft-called "question" pronouns like "Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How."

|          | Interrogative | Proximal | Distal | Indefinite |
|:--------:|:--------------|:---------|:-------|:-----------|
| **Person**   | _qi_ (who, whom) | _bawin\*_ (this one) | _yawin\*_ (that one) | _wi_ (who, whom)<br>_coridin\*_ (someone) |
| **Object** | _qe_ (what, which) | _ba_ (this) | _ya_ (that) | _cori_ (some) |
| **Reason** | _sif_ (why) | _basif\*_ (this reason) | _yasif\*_ (that reason) | _corisif\*_ (some reason) |
| **Time** | _monsi_ (when) | _ju_ (now) | _kyorel_ (then) | _corimonsi\*_ (some-when) |
| **Place** | _dán_ (where) | _natha_ (here) | _mué_ (there) | _coridán\*_ (somewhere) |
| **Manner** | _del_ (how) | _badel\*_ (this manner) | _yadel\*_ (that manner) | _coridel\*_ (some manner) |

The entries with asterisks are constructions or compound words (which may not be fully documented elsewhere).
