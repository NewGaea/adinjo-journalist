Articles such as *a, an*, and *the* are not strictly necessary in Adinjo Journalist. They are available, and are used in very formal language, such as novels, essays, and contracts, but are widely ignored in everyday speech. We aim to present these sentences with the articles included, but to help show that they are not, the phrasebook will keep them in parentheses for the example lines in Journalist.
