Our glossing conventions are as follows:

```gloss
\ex (Sug) xáron (dan) kieretax faileton.
\gla sug xáron dan kiere-tax faile-ton
\glb DEF mage INDEF woodwork-tradesman love-PRES
\glc The mage a woodworker loves.
\ft The mage loves a woodworker.
```

1. The first line of each gloss is **an example presented in strong, bold text.** This line presents the text using the romanization guidelines already established, with no indications of how words are constructed.
2. The second line begins the gloss, and uses _emphatic, italic text with the following conventions:_
	+ Two elements connected with a **hyphen** \<-\> are separate morphemes, usually referring to _gender-marking_ or used in _compound words._
	+ Two elements separated by a **period** \<.\> are derivational elements such as clitics or affixes. Most sentences will contain this in their verb at the least.
3. The third line is the **gloss**, which breaks down the meaning of the sentence. This includes glossing terms and shorthands such as 1S for "first-person singular" or DEF for "definite article." On this line, anything written in CAPS or using NUMERALS (0-9) is a glossing value, while anything written in lowercase is the gloss, or translated choice, for a word. The glossing convention of 2 above also apply to compound elements.
	1. On this line, Vocatives are written with First-Letter Capitalization, rather than in all-caps as they would be on other lines
4. The fourth line is an English Gloss, which preserves the word order of Adinjo but uses English words to translate any element that can be translated.
5. The last line, _"Quoted in emphasis or italic style,"_ is a free translation, or how an English speaker might choose to represent the sample in a normal English format.
