## What is Adinjo Journalist

Adinjo Journalist is a conlang maintained by New Gaea Entertainment for use in stories, games, and artwork of the Shattered Verse settings, especially New Gaea and Atrusius.

The language has been developed in fits and bits since 1998. The original name of the Adin people was developed in the late summer, the original (and now well-defunct) script was developed for personal journaling, and the first words were substitutes for specific English words.

Over the 25 years since the language began with a single word, it has grown in size and usefulness, and has been retired and resumed several times. But enough history, you're here to learn.

## Who Uses Adinjo Journalist

Adinjo Journalist is the lingua franca of the _Holy Adin Empire_, and is spoken by politicians, diplomats, merchants, and anybody who deals with cultures other than their own. It has been preserved through cultivated maintenance for over 2000 years, with regular collection of usage to keep it viable.

With that said, it is not unlike Church Latin due to how it has been preserved. There are modern dialects of Adinjo which do not follow the rules presented here, but most of those dialects will be able to understand Adinjo Journalist to a moderate degree. They will be explored in other places.

This book is intended to help you, a modern human, learn enough Adinjo Journalist to understand easter eggs and code switching within New Gaea stories.
