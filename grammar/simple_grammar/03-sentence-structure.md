## Sentences

Sentences in Adinjo are broadly straightforward, flowing from the Subject, to the Object or Objects, to the Verb, or SOV order.

```gloss
\ex (Sug) xáron (dan) kieretax faileton.
\gla sug xáron dan kiere-tax faile-ton
\glb DEF mage INDEF woodwork-tradesman love-PRES
\glc The mage a woodworker loves.
\ft The mage loves a woodworker.
```
The _articles_ in Adinjo are the definite **_[sug](lexicon/s/sug)_** (the) and the indefinite **_[dan](lexicon/d/dan)_** (a, an). They are optional, but can be helpful to distinguish between the noun phrases in a sentence, especially as you are learning the language.

In addition, our glossing conventions are as follows:

1. The first line of each gloss is **an example presented in strong, bold text.** This line presents the text using the romanization guidelines already established, with no indications of how words are constructed.
2. The second line begins the gloss, and uses _emphatic, italic text with the following conventions:_
	+ Two elements connected with a **hyphen** \<-\> are separate morphemes, usually referring to _gender-marking_ or used in _compound words._
	+ Two elements separated by a **period** \<.\> are derivational elements such as clitics or affixes. Most sentences will contain this in their verb at the least.
3. The third line is the **gloss**, which breaks down the meaning of the sentence. This includes glossing terms and shorthands such as 1S for "first-person singular" or DEF for "definite article." On this line, anything written in CAPS or using NUMERALS (0-9) is a glossing value, while anything written in lowercase is the gloss, or translated choice, for a word. The glossing convention of 2 above also apply to compound elements.
	1. On this line, Vocatives are written with First-Letter Capitalization, rather than in all-caps as they would be on other lines
4. The fourth line is an English Gloss, which preserves the word order of Adinjo but uses English words to translate any element that can be translated.
5. The last line, _"Quoted in emphasis or italic style,"_ is a free translation, or how an English speaker might choose to represent the sample in a normal English format.

### Common Glossing Terms

**NOTE:** For simplicity, some common glossing terms are provided here in tables for reference. This is only the most common terms, a more detailed list of terms can be found in the Advanced Grammar.

### Case

Adinjo only has three cases: the **nominative, genitive,** and **vocative.** All nouns are listed in their nominative form, and the genitive is always marked by the prefixed clitic \<_ku-_\> or \<_k-_\>.

The genitive is used to indicate ownership or superior role between two members of the same noun phrase.

```gloss
\ex Kuhiro dantax sug kontagro hemlétot.
\gla ku.hiro dan.tax sug kontagro hemle.tot
\glb GEN.king serve.worker DEF marketplace move.towards.PAST
\glc king's servant the market went
\ft The king's servant went to the market.
```

Here we see the superior role being indicated -- the king is superior to the servant, though the servant remains the subject of the sentence. It's worth noting that because of how the genitive works, **_kuhiro_** could be placed either before _or_ after **_dantax_** without changing the meaning of the sentence.

```gloss
\ex Kuyi lirja ci-hemlé lum gìlden lukartot.
\gla ku.yi lirja ci-hemlé lum gìlden lukar.tot
\glb GEN.yi lirja 2S-towards six gìlden offer.PRES
\glc My message you-to six gilden offers.
\ft My message offers you six gilden (gold coins).
```

This example demonstrates the ownership reading of the genitive. In the case of ownership, it is strongly preferred to place the genitive before the owned portion of a phrase, even though the superior role may be freely placed before or after the primary noun of the phrase.

The vocative is only represented in writing, not speech, and is indicated by writing a word in all-capital letters. It is normally used for names or other proper nouns.

```gloss
\ex SUG ODÌSSÍ HOMERma qontot.
\gla "SUG ODÌSSÍ" "HOMER".ma qon.tot
\glb DEF Odyssey Homer.attrib write.PAST
\glc The Odyssey Homer.by wrote
\ft "The Odyssey" was written by Homer.
```

### Gender

Adinjo Journalist is not a gendered language, though it does have a way to indicate the gender of a noun. Because gender is not grammatical, but only **semantic,** this means that these gender suffixes are often used to makes gendered words, like _kitaiti_ (female dog) or _somen_ (male master).

| Gender | Suffix (Sing.) | Suffix (Plural) |
|:-------|:---------------|:----------------|
| **Masculine** | _-èn_ | _-ènu_ |
| **Feminine** | _-(d)aití_ | _-(d)aitínu_ |
| **Dual** | _-lai_ | _-lainu_ |
| **Neuter** | _-ent_ | _-entu_ |
| **Genderless** | _-on_ | _-onu_ |

These words are marked, and not every noun ending with one of these suffixes is necessarily gendered.

### Pluralization

In Adinjo, nouns may be singular or plural, however if an explicit number is present, the plural form is optional. Some words (sometimes called _uncountables_) take the same form whether they are singular or plural. In the case of most nouns, the plural is indicated by the clitic suffix \<nu\> or \<u\>. There are some exceptions to this rule (notably, \<_dyn_\> becomes \<_din_\>), but those will be addressed as you learn them.

#### Simple Plural Form

```gloss
\ex Yi dan kosij gìlden airentot.
\gla yi dan kosij gìlden airen.tot
\glb 1S INDEF eight gold.coin find.PAST
\glc I an eight gold.coin found
\ft I found eight gìlden.
```

Here we see that the explicit number, **eight,** is accompanied by the singular _gìlden_. While precise numbers may seem an obvious case for this, even vague numbers like _tomonu_ (dozens) allow for this manner of unmarked pluralization. You may opt use the explicit plural with a number, but you are not required to.

```gloss
\ex LUKA cori gìldenu enmitot.
\gla LUKA cori gìlden.u enmi.tot
\glb Luka some gold.coin.PL lose.PAST
\glc Luka some gold.coins lost
\ft Luka lost some gold coins.
```
And here we see the implicit number _cori_ (some) pairs with the explicit plural _gìldenu._ When a number is implicit, like *cori*, or absent, it is important to make sure to use the explicit plural.

#### Countable vs. Uncountable

Adinjo Journalist does have a distinction between countable and uncountable nouns, similar to English. For example, *rash* "sand" is an uncountable noun in normal use, you cannot explicitly number it by saying something like *jon rash* "three sands" -- you must instead say *jon irenu rashi* "three grains of sand" or *jon rashinu* "three bits of sand" to pluralize *rashi*.

---
#### Universal Form

In addition to pluralization, the prefix \<a-\> may be used to create the **universal**, which may be singular or plural itself.

```gloss
\ex Yi ba twa ni azekenal qontot.
\gla yi ba twa ni a-zekenal qon.tot
\glb 1S PROX book in UNIV.note write.PAST
\glc I this book in all.note wrote
\ft I wrote all the notes in this book.
```
The universal refers to a large group of something, and is similar to the way English speakers might refer to groups by simply using their name. For example _AFRANSDIN_ would be the equivalent of "the French" or "French people," with the implication of a stereotype, or other broad or universal statement about that group.

```gloss
\ex Ki adin banu xaflanu gelmau ijinton...
\gla ki a.din ba.nu lan.xaf.u gelm.au ijin.ton
\glb 1PL UNIV.people this.PL REFL.truth.PL confidence.DESC know.PRES
\glc We people these self-truths confidently know...
\ft We, the people, know these truths of themselves with confidence...
```
In this sample, we have another form of explicit pluralization, in _ki adin_ ("we, the people") where the plural pronoun _ki_ and the referent _adin_ agree ()

**NOTE:** In words beginning with \<a\>, the universal prefix becomes \<á\> replacing the original \<a\>. If the word begins with \<á\>, it becomes \<ay\> without replacing the original \<á\>.
