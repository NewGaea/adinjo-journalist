## Pronouns

A pronoun stands in for a noun or noun phrase. They can largely be divided into two categories in Adinjo: personal pronouns and referential pronouns.

### Personal Pronouns

```gloss
\ex Yi GRUT ic.
\gla yi GRUT ic
\glb 1S Grut be.PRES
\glc I Groot am
\ft I am Groot.
```
A simple statement using the first person singular, this is a common and casual introduction (unless you happen to be Groot).

```gloss
\ex Ci kuLANA failedyn ic.
\gla ci ku.LANA faile-dyn ic
\glb 2S GEN.Lana love-person be.PRES
\glc You Lana's lover are.
\ft You are Lana's lover.
```
This demonstrates the second person singular. A simple statement of (presumed) fact.

```gloss
\ex JULZ hi ku≈üi habijadu corinanfailia ic.
\gla JULZ hi ku-shi habijad.u corinan.failia ic.
\glb Julz and GEN.3SN partner.PL some.lovestyle ic.
\glc Jules and their partners polyamorous are.
\ft Jules and their partners are polyamorous.
```
Using the properly gendered pronoun is not only polite, it's a common courtesy in Adinjo. If you don't know the pronouns an individual uses, _shi_ is the most preferred term (neutral rather than unknown).
