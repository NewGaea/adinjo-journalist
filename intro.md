The **Atlantean** language family of the Adin, spread now through the stars, but best known in the modern dialects found on _Atrusius_ and among the returning emissaries to New Gaea, extends back through a long period of relatively slow evolution. The earliest period with any records was the tribal period, before the unification under **Yreons the Glorious** and the dawn of the Imperial Era. **Proto-Adinjo** is the reconstructed language that predates the tribal era, and is believed to connect the **Atlantean** languages to **Proto-Indo-European**.

The environment of the land later called **Atlantis** was a combination of tropical environs in the south and temperate environs to the north, generally delineated by the presence of the volcanic mountain ridge near the center of the island.  Though the four regions were not so cleanly divided, the general sense is that in the tribal era, there were four sub-families, with each tribe speaking its own language within one of these families. It is not known how the connection to Proto-Indo-European came to be, but it seems that Proto-Adinjo is is composed of roots derived largely from Proto-Indo-European, supplemented with words unique to the Atlantean families for things not found in Indo-European lands.

Adinjo, the current name of the language family, is from a term meaning “the peoples’ tongue” or “the language of the people” in a language nwo called _Original Adinjo_.
