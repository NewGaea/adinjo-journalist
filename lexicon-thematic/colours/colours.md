# Colours in Adinjo Journalist

Adin have similar vision to other humans, and so have a similar palette of colors they can see.

+ **Black, White**: The words originally made for black and white were _absé_ and _abso_, though later development has made these words that refer to brightness rather than pigment. They are related to the modern word _bès_ which means "saturation" or "brightness".
+ **Black**: New word coined 2022, _\*bhasto_ -> _\*bhasso_ -> _\*pásso_ -> _pazo_
+ **White**: New word coined 2022, _\*bhista_ -> _\*vista_ -> _\*vitsa_ -> _vic_
+ **Red**: Originally coined early, _roha_ fits with the modern feel of the language as a hybrid of an _a priori_ language that met with a PIE related language
+ **Green**: Similarly early, _veron_ may be one of the earliest words ever coined, and fits this theme.
+ **Yellow**: originally coined as _ksiron_, the independent _ks_ sound is no longer valid in word-onset positions. Since 2021, _ciron_ /tsiron/ is the preferred form for this word
+ **Blue**: Another early coinage was _arzol_, a catch-all term for blue, though in recent years there has been some thought to adding a complementary term for _light blue_ (cyan, sky blue).

Additional Colour words:

+ **Purple, Violet**: _véol_ showcases some of the laziness of the early coinages made under pressure
+ **Pale, Faded**: _lavèn_ was coined specifically to create the meaningful name of "pale flower" for the word _lavèndur_
+ **Grey**: _fir_ was probably coined without much sense of pressure, as it doesn't appear closely related to any Romance or other PIE forms I know of
+ **Pink, Pale Red**: _harth_
+ **Orange**: _narug_ is potentially loosely derived from Español _naranja_, and thus fitting with the other PIE-derived colour terms
