[[lexicon/a/_a|Return to List of Words beginning with A]]


### Alternative Forms

- **a'** (_prefix_) used before words which begin with a vowel other than \<**a**\>
- **á** (_prefix_) for words which begin with \<**a**\> or \<e\>
- **ay'** (_prefix_) for words which begin with any _asent_-marked vowel.
- **'a** (_suffix_) variant indicating glottal stop
- **ha** (_suffix_) full version of negative suffix, used for words ending in vowels
## Etymology

**_a_** is two words, and both can be used as identical prefixes.

The suffix -**_a_** is actually derived from **_ha_**, and in some contexts uses the form **_-ha_**.

## Pronunciation
- **IPA Broad**: /ʔaː(ʔ)/ ![listen](audio/01-adob/mp3/a.mp3)

## Pronoun

### **a-**
1. (_prefix_) all, every, or each _noun_ or _pronoun_; used as a prefix, indicates the contextual universal group.

## Descriptor
### **a-**
1. (_prefix_) great, grand, superior to other members of a class
### -'a
1. (_suffix_; cf. *[ha](../h/ha.md)*) no, not, negative; this suffix indicates the opposite or negative of the word to which is is applied. While not always written, there is a glottal stop between the root and this suffix.

- **[adin](lexicon/a/adin.md)**
	1. (_universal noun_) the people
- **[ADIN](lexicon/a/adin.md)**
	1. (_proper noun_) the Adin people
	
	Note: _It is impractical to list all of the words which use **a** as a derivational element, however all words which use **a** as a derivational element will include **a** in their related words list. The words listed above are included because they were the source of the prefix, as they were created before the language itself was formally started._

#### -a

	1. (_descriptor_) no, negative, not
