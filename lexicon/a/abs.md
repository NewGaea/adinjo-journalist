### Derivation ###

The fundamental root of these near homonyms is **bès**, with the prefix **a**. \<**bès**\> refers to light without color, and is equivalent to the concept of 'grey.'

_a_ + _bès_ + _(h)a_ -> _abèsa_ -> _absèa_ -> **_abse_** (note the inclusion of _(h)a_ which is the negative suffix, and the source of the absence of light, and the lengthening of \<è\> to \<e\> in **abse**)

_a_ + _bès_ -> _abès_ -> _absè_ -> **_abso_** (Adinjo is not fond of the sound produced by \<è\> in word-final positions, and it will usually dissimilate to \<o\> in the final syllable of any word which ends with \<è\>, thus leading to **abso**)
