## Etymology
### Internal Etymology
From Ancient Adinjo **bès** "lightness", from a construction believed to have been "_a_ + _bès_" ${\rightarrow}$ _abès_ ${\rightarrow}$ _absè_ ${\rightarrow}$ **_abso_**. Adinjo is not fond of the sound produced by \<è\> in word-final positions, and it will usually dissimilate to \<o\> in the final syllable of any word which ends with \<è\>.
### External Origin
From Modern English ***absolute*** in reference to visible light containing all wavelengths. 

## Pronunciation
- **IPA Broad**: /ab.'so:/
