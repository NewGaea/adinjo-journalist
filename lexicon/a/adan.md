## Forms
1. **adan** (_pronoun_) #pronoun ![listen](audio/01-adob/mp3/adan.mp3)
	1. any, anybody, any one, no specific one
		- This pronoun is a singular referring to a member of a group. It allows the listener to determine which member it applies to, and is sometimes used in literature to preserve mystery or create suspense. In such cases, the phrase **_[ki](../k/ki.md) adan_** is common, and means something similar to _one of us_.

### Other Forms

1. **adanu** (_pronoun, plural_) anybody, anyone; refers to multiple indefinite people

### Derivation

**Adan** is a straightforward derivation of **a** + **dan**, turning the classifier and particle into an indefinite pronoun, meaning any member of a group. It was, however, derived in an earlier stage of the language, and is singular in number, rather than universal.
