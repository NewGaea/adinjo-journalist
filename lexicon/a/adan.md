# adan

# Adinjo
## Alternative Forms
- **a dan**

## Etymology
**Adan** is a straightforward derivation of [**a**](lexicon/a/a-.md) + [**dan**](lexicon/d/dan.md), turning the classifier and particle into an indefinite pronoun, meaning any member of a group. It was, however, **derived in an earlier stage of the language**, and is singular in number, rather than universal.

## Pronunciation
- **IPA Broad**: /a.'dan/ ![listen](audio/01-adob/mp3/adan.mp3)

## Pronoun

### adan (plural *adanu*)
1. any, anybody, any one, no specific one
	1. This pronoun is a singular referring to a member of a group. It allows the listener to determine which member it applies to, and is sometimes used in literature to preserve mystery or create suspense. In such cases, the phrase **_[ki](../k/ki.md) adan_** is common, and means something similar to _one of us_.
