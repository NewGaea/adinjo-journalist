# almatax

# Adinjo
## Alternative Forms

## Etymology
The word **almatax** is derived from a modern process, combining the words [**alma**](lexicon/a/alma) _to lead_ and [**tax**](lexicon/t/tax) _professional_, thus literally meaning _lead-professional_ or a person who leads as a profession.

## Pronunciation
- **IPA Broad**: /al.maˑ.tax/

## Noun

### almatax (plural *almataxu*)
1. governor, ruler
2. coach, manager
3. preacher, professor, teacher
4. judge, jury, tribunal
5. court

**Almataxu** are leaders by training or profession, but they are generally not the highest level of leadership. Sometimes, leaders who deserve a higher title (military or noble titles) will attempt to adopt this title to create a more casual or informal atmosphere, though this is very rare.
# Thesaurus
## Synonyms
- [**almán**](lexicon/a/almán): leader, ruler, manager, governor; a leader by profession, but one who is not the highest authority; this title _may_ be adopted by higher leaders who wish to create an atmosphere of familiarity, though this is rare
