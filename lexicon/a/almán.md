# almán

# Adinjo
## Alternative Forms

## Etymology
The word **almán** is derived from the words [**alma**](lexicon/a/alma) "to lead" and the diminutive suffix -*yn* from [**dyn**](lexicon/d/dyn) "person." This derivation is still meaningful, but unlike most derivations involving \<y>, this \<-yn> serves to accent the preceding vowel rather than acting as an /i/ in a diphthong.

## Pronunciation
- **IPA Broad**: /al.ˈmæːn/

## Noun

### almán (plural *almánu*)
1. chief, elder, governor, leader, mayor
	1. This term often applies to small local leaders who rule especially through the respect and trust of those they lead.
2. acting leader, circumstantial leader
	1. This term most often refers to leaders by circumstance or chance, for any reason other than seeking to be a leader or political figure
3. bad leader, poor leader
	1. used to refer to a leader whom one sees as having no mandate, right, or will to lead or govern

**Almánu** are always considered to be leaders by circumstance, rather than leaders by profession or training. They may be fully qualified, they may have _the will to lead_ as noted in definition three, but they are almost always seen as short-term leaders of necessity or circumstance, who did not choose to be in the leadership position. For a leader who chooses to actively pursue or maintain their position, see [**almatax**](lexicon/a/almatax)
