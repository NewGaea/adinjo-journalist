## Derivation

> The following information may be irrelevant internally, but still reflects the origins of the word from a real-world perspective.

**BÁBUL** is the name of a mythical site where non-Adin humans attempted to build a monument to themselves. This story is retained by the Adin as a lesson in the pride of humans, and among the more religious and spiritual Adin, is believed to be the reason why all people have different languages, as well as why languages change over time.

Unlike the Judeo-Christian mythology, where the name _Babel_ is said to be due to the scattering of languages, the Adin call the place **BÁBUL** because of the monument, not because of the scattering of languages.
