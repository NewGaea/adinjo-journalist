### Derivation ###

/_bès_/ refers to light without color, and is equivalent to the concept of 'grey.'

_a_ + _bès_ + _(h)a_ -> _abèsa_ -> _absèa_ -> **_abse_** (note the inclusion of _(h)a_ which is the negative suffix, and the source of the absence if light in **abse**)

_a_ + _bès_ -> _abès_ -> _absè_ -> **_abso_** (adinjo is not fond of the sound produced by \<è\>, and it will usually dissimilate to \<o\> in the first and final syllables of words which start or end in \<è\>, thus leading to **abso**)
