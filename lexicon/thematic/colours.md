# Colours in Adinjo Journalist

Adin have similar vision to other humans, and so have a similar palette of colors they can see.

+ **Black, White**: The words originally made for black and white were [_absé_ and _abso_](lexicon/a/abs), though later development has changed these words so that they refer to brightness rather than pigment. They are related to the modern word _bès_ which means "saturation" or "brightness".
+ **Black**: New word coined 2022, _\*bhasto_ -> _\*bhasso_ -> _\*pásso_ -> [_pazo_](lexicon/p/pazo)
+ **White**: New word coined 2022, _\*bhista_ -> _\*vista_ -> _\*vitsa_ -> [_vic_](lexicon/v/vic)
+ **Red**: Originally coined early, [_roha_](lexicon/r/roha) fits with the modern feel of the language as a hybrid of an _a priori_ language that met with a PIE related language
+ **Green**: Similarly early, [_veron_](lexicon/v/veron) may be one of the earliest words ever coined, and fits this theme.
+ **Yellow**: originally coined as _ksiron_, the independent _ks_ sound is no longer valid in word-onset positions. Since 2021, [_ciron_](lexicon/c/ciron) /tsiron/ is the preferred form for this word
+ **Blue**: Another early coinage was [_arzol_](lexicon/a/arzol), a catch-all term for blue, though in recent years there has been some thought to adding a complementary term for _light blue_ (cyan, sky blue).

## Additional Colour Words

+ **Purple, Violet**: [_véol_](lexicon/v/véol) showcases some of the laziness of the early coinages made under pressure
+ **Pale, Faded**: [_lavèn_](lexicon/l/lavèn) was coined specifically to create the meaningful name of "pale flower" for the word _lavèndur_
+ **Grey**: [_fir_](lexicon/f/fir) was probably coined without much sense of pressure, as it doesn't appear closely related to any Romance or other PIE forms I know of
+ **Pink, Pale Red**: [_harth_](lexicon/h/harth)
+ **Orange**: [_narug_](lexicon/n/narug) is potentially loosely derived from Español _naranja_, and thus fitting with the other PIE-derived colour terms
