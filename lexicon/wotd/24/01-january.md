# 01 - Dama, Dama.rio

- **dama** 1. (_descriptor_) new (att. 2003-Dec-25)
- **dama.rio** 1. (_ton verb_) happening, occurring, especially inevitably or passively (att. 2003-Apr-24) 2. also _damarion, damarionu_ (_noun, descriptor_) happenings, news, new event, news story (cn. 2023-May-27)

Something interesting happened here, and despite the dates, it seems a little tricky for me to know which of these words is actually older. I can date the original senses of both to 2003 (back in "Adin" V1 days), which means they may have been coined close together, but the homophony is, I think, an accident (this might relate to the way I coined verbs back then.)

That said, in 2023, I officially added a sense to **damario** that I'd been using for a while: the news. Reports about current events or happenings fit rather smoothly under "happenings" (*damarionu*) and this strengthened the relationship between **dama** and **damario** (though not of either to **damai** "thanking", likely because *damai* was a new coinage in 2023)

But how can we extend these a bit to make the language more flexible?

- **dama** 2. (_noun_) novelty, gimmick, toy (cn. 2024-Jan-01)

This sense builds off of the descriptive sense of *dama* while helping it serve to label things that may not quite catch on.

- **dama.rio** 3. trending, becoming popular, going viral, hitting it big (cn. 2024-Jan-01)

Could we add anything else, reasonably? Well, I do have one thought...

- **dama** 3. (_positional_) currently, presently, here and now; this sense refers to a point in place and time simultaneously (cn. 2024-Jan-01)

Of course, we could also extend the existing sense a little bit, leaving us with a final entry something like this:

- **dama** 1. (_descriptor_) new, _novel, unique, creative, inventive, playful, clever_; this sense describes things and ideas, generally not people 2. (_noun_) novelty, gimmick, toy (cn. 2024-Jan-01) 3. (_positional_) currently, presently, here and now; this sense refers to a point in place and time simultaneously (cn. 2024-Jan-01)
- **dama.rio** 1. (_ton verb_) happening, occurring, especially inevitably or passively (att. 2003-Apr-24) 2. also _damarion, damarionu_ (_noun, descriptor_) happenings, news, new event, news story (cn. 2023-May-27) 3. (_ton verb_) trending, becoming popular, going viral, hitting it big (cn. 2024-Jan-01)
