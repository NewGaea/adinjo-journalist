# 01 - \[262] Dama, \[267] Dama.rio

- **dama** 1. (_descriptor_) new (att. 2003-Dec-25)
- **dama.rio** 1. (_ton verb_) happening, occurring, especially inevitably or passively (att. 2003-Apr-24) 2. also _damarion, damarionu_ (_noun, descriptor_) happenings, news, new event, news story (cn. 2023-May-27)

Something interesting happened here, and despite the dates, it seems a little tricky for me to know which of these words is actually older. I can date the original senses of both to 2003 (back in "Adin" V1 days), which means they may have been coined close together, but the homophony is, I think, an accident (this might relate to the way I coined verbs back then.)

That said, in 2023, I officially added a sense to **damario** that I'd been using for a while: the news. Reports about current events or happenings fit rather smoothly under "happenings" (*damarionu*) and this strengthened the relationship between **dama** and **damario** (though not of either to **damai** "thanking", likely because *damai* was a new coinage in 2023)

But how can we extend these a bit to make the language more flexible?

- **dama** 2. (_noun_) novelty, gimmick, toy (cn. 2024-Jan-01)

This sense builds off of the descriptive sense of *dama* while helping it serve to label things that may not quite catch on.

- **dama.rio** 3. trending, becoming popular, going viral, hitting it big (cn. 2024-Jan-01)

Could we add anything else, reasonably? Well, I do have one thought...

- **dama** 3. (_positional_) currently, presently, here and now; this sense refers to a point in place and time simultaneously (cn. 2024-Jan-01)

Of course, we could also extend the existing sense a little bit, leaving us with a final entry something like this:

- **dama** 1. (_descriptor_) new, _novel, unique, creative, inventive, playful, clever_; this sense describes things and ideas, generally not people 2. (_noun_) novelty, gimmick, toy (cn. 2024-Jan-01) 3. (_positional_) currently, presently, here and now; this sense refers to a point in place and time simultaneously (cn. 2024-Jan-01)
- **dama.rio** 1. (_ton verb_) happening, occurring, especially inevitably or passively (att. 2003-Apr-24) 2. also _damarion, damarionu_ (_noun, descriptor_) happenings, news, new event, news story (cn. 2023-May-27) 3. (_ton verb_) trending, becoming popular, going viral, hitting it big (cn. 2024-Jan-01)

# 02 - \[304] Dér'enex, \[303] Dér

This is an interesting one. Still ironing out a methodology for picking my Word of the Day, so today I rolled d1000 (slight error, I have 1400-ish lines in my Journalist lexicon file), but I rolled a 3-0-4 and line 304 is the derived term *dér'enex* "formal rode, dress robe; evening gown, suit, tuxedo." Of course, I want to generally focus on one word per day, and while I could play with the rolled term, it's more interesting to review the prefix here:

- **dér** 1. (_prefix, descriptor_) `a.` proper, polite, formal `b.` \[fashion\] dress, formal attire; attire suited for a wedding, court, or ball) (att. 2008-Jun-22)

The first thing I note here is the attestation date. **dér** was apparently not given its own entry in the lexicon until 2008-Jun-22 -- **dér'enex** on the other hand was coined around 2004-Jul-13 -- nearly four years earlier. We'll fix this attestation date in the final entry for today, but first, let's look at how we might build on the word. Since it was coined, it has always had a meaning connected to "formal" clothing, what can we extend out of that?

How about "the proper or right way of doing things"? Etiquette or manners, following proper procedures or instructions? In fact, it already means "polite" (1.a) so this is a logical extension:

- **dér** 2. (_noun_) etiquette, manners, politeness, respectful behaviour (cn. 2024-Jan-02) 3. indirection, euphemism, epithet, respectful words (cn. 2024-Jan-02) 4. (_descriptor_) noble, cultured, refined, well-mannered, couth (cn. 2024-Jan-02)

I think that looks good for a pretty early step forward in the new year. I can use this to help build even more compound terms, with more flexibility than just "proper, polite, formal" made clear:

- **dér** 1. (_prefix, descriptor_) `a.` proper, polite, formal `b.` \[fashion\] dress, formal attire; attire suited for a wedding, court, or ball) (att. 2004-Jul-13; in *dér'enex* "formal robe") 2. (_noun_) etiquette, manners, politeness, respectful behaviour (cn. 2024-Jan-02) 3. indirection, euphemism, epithet, respectful words (cn. 2024-Jan-02) 4. (_descriptor_) noble, cultured, refined, well-mannered, couth (cn. 2024-Jan-02)

# 03 - \[903] Morneyaci
