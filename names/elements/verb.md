# Adinjo Journalist Name Elements: Nouns

Adinjo names may be derived from nouns, verbs, or descriptors, but usually take the least inflected form as their basis. The table below shows many, though not all, common name elements. Some names may be simple words, but a name may typically be composed of two or three elements.

## Verbs as Naming Roots

The words in these tables reflect commonly used verbs in Adinjo names. Most verbs can be shortened to their first syllable or two, use a middle syllable, or use their final syllable when used in a name -- these are called the Initial, Medial, and Final elements, but they are not related to their position within the name, only within the word they originally come from.
