# Bankust

**Bankust** is a family name based on a trade or profession. Children raised with this name who do not follow in the profession of their footsteps are liable to change their name as they move into a trade or profession.

Bankust means *breadsmith* and refers to someone who makes a wide variety of baked good, including pastries. Note that a bankust is an artisan, in contrast with with those who bake from recipes or incidentally to other cooking. It can be considered equivalent to an English name like **Baker** or French **Dupain**.

This name contrasts with *[Bantax](bantax.md)* and refers to an individual, or to a family headed by someone, who is deeply and actively engaged in the craft of bread production, not just one who happens to work in a bakery.
