# Ancient Names

These names have traditional meanings and are preserved out of respect for their bearers, weather they are currently alive or dead (or of unknown fate). These names do not conform to the typical rules of modern names in terms of element ordering, spelling, or phonetics -- in particular, they may be spelled based on the modern spellings used for the deities of ancient cultures they were mistaken for.

The spellings in parentheses are the Adinjo spellings and forms of these names. Where possible, attempts will be made to include the meaning of the original name in Adinjo, as well as a modernised form of the name.

## The Olympian Emissaries

These emissaries had great contact with Greece, Macedonia, and Rome over the ages, and hold to the names of the deities they were once mistaken for.
