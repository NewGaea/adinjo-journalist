# Luko

**Luko** is a moderately rare masculine personal name. The name is often said to be derived from *lukard* "offer, proposition" 

The name is also sometimes said to also include the *ko* from words such as *kobal* "memory", *kongera* "praise", or *koremn* "heaven." Those who claim this origin often say it is a way of showing thanks to the spirits or gods, for sons born out of difficult pregnancies.

While very rare, the name may be turned into Luka, or Lukaiti, for a daughter.
