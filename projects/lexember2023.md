## 08 - Cycles: Days and Seasons

... I only have one season name? Let's fix this:

:book_mudora: **shuka** 1. (_noun_) winter, cold season, cold-wet season (att. 2007-Nov-26)
:leaf_korok: **amuran** 1. (_noun._) spring, warming season; (c. 2023-Dec-08; from _amurent_ "scattering, sowing")
:leaf_korok: **gir** 1. (_desc._) warm, hot; a good state for a fresh cooked meal or brewed drink to be in (gen. 2022-06-23, c. 2023-Dec-08)
:leaf_korok: **girina** 1. (_noun._) summer, warm season, hot-dry season (gen. 2022-06-23, c. 2023-Dec-08)
:leaf_korok: **julaxde** 1. (_noun._) autumn, harvest season, cool season (c. 2023-Dec-08; from _julaxan_ "changing")
:leaf_korok: **jumashuka** 1. (_noun._) dry winter, dead season, cold-dry season (c. 2023-Dec-08; from _jumano_ "dying" and _shuka_ "winter")
:leaf_korok: **magérina** 1. (_noun._) wet summer, monsoon season, storm season (c. 2023-Dec-08; from _makend_ "raining" and *girina* "summer")

While these seasons don't all apply to every region on Earth or New Gaea, much of Atrusius goes through six distinct seasons, generally running through the year with two harvest times.

When a new year begins, the season in the northern environs is usually *shuka* or the wet winter, when cold rain and snow fall. This leads into *amuran*, the first planting season, and ends with a harvest early on in *girina*, the dry summer.

After *girina*, the wet summer *magérina* arrives and allows a second planting of crops which are more resilient to heavy rains, and which are harvested during *julaxde* as the weather becomes drier. After the harvest, the peak cold periods arrive, called *jumashuka* as it can become cold, and dry, enough that it can become dangerous (it's also the peak season for contagious illnesses)
