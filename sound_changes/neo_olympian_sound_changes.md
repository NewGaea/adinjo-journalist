# Sound Changes from Adinjo Journalist to Neo-Olympian Adinjo

The following sound-changes reflect on the results of two inter-stellar voyages between the worlds of New Gaea and Atrusius.

## Stage I: Passage to Atrusius

### Stops plus Diphthongs

Non-glottal plosives or stops followed by vowel pairs (whether or not they are formal diphthongs) tend to become labialized or palatalized based on the diphthong.

This follows a trend of treating these pairs as semi-vowel onglides, but shifts the recognition towards the consonant. The glottal stop /'/ is usually flipped into the middle of these diphthongs rather than becoming labialized or palatalized. This rule applies to any word without an explicit glottal stop between the vowel pairs, and can apply multiple times per word:

+ Stops followed by /o/ or /u/ diphthongs become labialized, and drop the influencing vowel
+ Stops followed by /i/ oe /e/ diphthongs become palatalized, and drop the influencing vowel
+ Word-initial diphthongs take on the appropriate change at the same.

Some examples of words affected by this:

+ **ADJ** /koen/ -> /qen/
+ **ADJ** /huir/ -> /hwir/
