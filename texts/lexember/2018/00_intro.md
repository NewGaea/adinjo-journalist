# It’s Lexember!!

Hello, [r/conlangs](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/)! It’s [Allen](https://www.reddit.com/user/upallday_allen/), your newest ~dictator~ moderator, and it’s time for the annual celebration of… **Lexember**!

What does “Lexember” mean? This is a portmanteau that combines the terms “Lexicon” and “December”. This is Lexicon December. To further define terms, a “lexicon” is the collection of lexical items (“words”) available to a language (aka, the vocabulary), and “December” is the twelfth and final month of the Julian and Gregorian calendars.

This year, we the moderators are hosting a challenge: expand your lexicon! Every day - yes, _every day_ - one of us (probably me) will post three (3) prompts. Your job is to think creatively and insightfully about the prompts and answer one (or two or three) of them in the comments. Every now and then, we’ll include some helpful resources to help you think of terms in an exciting and engaging way.

## Rules!

<sup><sup>Everyone loves rules right?</sup></sup>

1. All words should be original. As in, you shouldn’t comment with terms that you’ve already created.
2. Your comment must include the following elements:
   a. **Your conlang’s name**
   b. **An original term that has been coined specifically for Lexember**
   c. **IPA notation of the word**
   d. **Definition** (NOT! a mere English translation)
   e. (OPTIONAL) An example sentence for one, some, or all of your terms.
   f. (OPTIONAL) An etymology of the word.
   g. (OPTIONAL) A short sentence expressing your appreciation to [u/Automod](https://www.reddit.com/u/Automod/).
3. All top-level comments must be either a response to one (1) or more prompts and/or a report of the new words that you've created.
4. If you coin terms for more than one conlang, each conlang _must_ have its own comment for ~maximum karma hoarding~.

**NOTE:** Moderators reserve the right to remove comments that do not abide by these rules.

## FAQ

### How many words can I coin per day?

As many as you’d like.

### Can I leave constructive feedback on other people’s replies and upvote high effort comments?

I would be kinda upset if you didn’t.

### What about other challenges?

Challenges like the Telephone Game and Five Minutes of Your Day will still be going strong. Feel free to participate in those! If you coin new words over there, you may include it in the Lexember activities.

### Are there any rewards?

Yes. Yes, there are rewards. Well, one specific reward. The author of the conlang with the most upvotes for the entire month will win the coveted **golden flair**!! For clarity, this count is based on conlang, not user. As an added stipulation, that user must have participated in _at least_ fifteen (15) Lexember challenges with the winning conlang.

### Why are you a mod, Allen?

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
