# Discussions on the Introduction & Rules for Lexember 2018

I have done my best to trim the fat from these threads to focus on specific questions (and answers) pertaining to the rules.

## [u/BRBoer](https://www.reddit.com/user/BRBoer/) asks for clarification on "Definition"

> > Definition (NOT! a mere English Translation)
>
> What does this mean Exactly?
>
> > [u/upallday_allen](https://www.reddit.com/user/upallday_allen/) **`OP`**
> >
> > This is primarily to prevent relexing and to encourage participants to think about how the word is used in context, rather than how the word translates in English.
> >
> > For example, we discourage entries like:
> >
> > > **magim** [məˈɡim] _n._ table
> >
> > ...but encourage entries like:
> >
> > > **magim** [məˈɡim] _n._ an eating table; countertop; bar or buffet; any surface where food is prepared, served, or enjoyed.
> >
> > We won't remove entries that have one-word definitions, but it's important to think deeply about the words you coin, whether they're specific or general, and to note that in your definitions.

## [u/GoddessTyche](https://www.reddit.com/user/GoddessTyche/) asks about newly-_composed_ words from existing elements

> A question: my conlang can make adverbial and phrasal verb equivalents by basically slapping a stative and a dynamic verb together and infixing postpositions before the inflection suffix. Would it count as a new word if I simply found a combo that works well for a given prompt? (it's not like you can check anyway)

While this answer is preserved, it is worth noting that [u/Red_Castle_Siblings](https://www.reddit.com/user/Red_Castle_Siblings/) asked a similar question about new compound words made of existing words, with an equivalent reply.

## [u/TypicalUser1](https://www.reddit.com/user/TypicalUser1/) asks about Scoring

> Hey, so I have a question here. Doesn't the upvote system give an advantage to those who catch the prompt post early over those who miss it? If so, do y'all have a way to compensate for that? I'm not particularly fussed about it myself, just want to know if y'all have considered it for those who might be more concerned than me.

> > I can perhaps add a short request to each Lexember post asking people to go back and upvote any good comments that they may have missed.

## [u/readthisresistor](https://www.reddit.com/user/readthisresistor/) asks about Diachronic Coinages

> Is it allowed if I coin words for the protolanguage and then show how they develop in a daughterlang? Would that be OK to put into one comment? (I'm only entering the protolang, not the daughterlang.)
> > [u/upallday_allen](https://www.reddit.com/user/upallday_allen/) **`OP`**
> >
> > Yes!
