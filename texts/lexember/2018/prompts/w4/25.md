# Giving

MERRY CHRISTMAS!! Because today’s a holiday for most of us and there’s probably a lot going on, we will only be doing one prompt today.

+ Coin some words pertaining to giving. (e.g., _to give, to send, to wrap (a present), to make happy, gift/present_, etc.)
+ **BONUS:** If you celebrate, list some of the gifts you’ve given and received this year!

## RESOURCE!

It would be silly of me not to point you to [The Linguistics of Giving](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V2pBX6Cs3NfA9XxVCCfYO0ZmJ9UYcA0B/view?usp=sharing), perfect for the holiday season and the nerd in all of us.
