# Wildlife, Mouth Noises & Your Surroundings

+ Coin some terms for wildlife that the speakers of your conlang may come in contact with.
+ Coin terms pertaining to noises made from one’s mouth. (e.g. _to speak, to scream, to hum, to laugh_, etc.) (Can include animal noises)
+ Lift your eyes from the computer screen for a moment and coin some terms that refer to the things that are around you. The sights, sounds, smells, and other sensations that you’re experiencing right now.

## FEEDBACK REQUEST

When you have the time, check out the Lexember 2018 Survey (Editor's Note: Link excluded; though the survey is still live it is quite untimely). This is to collect feedback and stats that will improve future Lexembers. The survey is entirely anonymous and all questions are optional. It should take you no more than ten minutes (unless you’re long winded like me). Thanks!
