Today we’re zooming in from fauna in general, to a specific type of fauna: HUMANS. The best of fauna, and the worst of fauna. Today we’re talking about different things to do with the species that I assume all of us are part of. Aliens and cryptids are welcome to take part in Lexember, too! If your conlang is meant to be spoken by some non-human species, then talk about them instead of humans.

## PERSON

_insan, rén, munu, maqlaqs, śauno, mtu_

Every individual human is a person. What even constitutes a person? What do your speakers consider to be the core elements of personhood? If you’ve got a non-human setting, what kinds of people are there there?

**Related words:** human, individual, individuality, personality, someone, anyone, everyone.

## ADULT

_granmoun, vuxen, mkulu, seongin, mecahasak, paheke_

A grown-up human. When are humans considered to be grown up by your speakers? Is there a coming-of-age ceremony where people become adults? What sorts of divisions are made among adults? If your speakers aren’t human, what does their maturation process look like?

**Related words:** to grow up, to mature, to develop, man, woman, elder, senior, parent, responsible, mature.

## CHILD

_nyithindo, sābəj, ayule, pikin, saimanjai, anak_

A child is a human that’s still half-baked. But when do you become fully baked? Do you ever become fully baked? A lot of cultures have distinctions for different kinds of children: babies who can’t talk, young children, teenagers who are totally definitely not children anymore, mom. What words do your speakers have for children and childhood?

**Related words:** baby, toddler, teenager, kid, childhood, childish, girl, boy, to be back in town (of the boys).

## FRIEND

_cara, draugas, kumpali, motswalle, púyena, dost_

Hello friends! I think a lot about different kinds of friends and how vague the term “friend” really is in English. Someone I met online last month? “A friend of mine.” Someone I’ve known closely since I was 10? Also “a friend of mine.” So how does your conlang talk about friends and friendship? Are there different words for different kinds of friends? Different kinds of friendship? What are some culturally significant markers of friendship?

**Related words:** friendship, acquaintance, to get to know someone, to make friends with someone, to befriend, to care about someone, friendly, kind, closely bonded.

## HUMANITY

_runakay, gizatasun, isintu, jinrui, hunga tāngata, mirovatî_

The collection of all human beings. The human species as a whole. This one’s already got some interesting polysemy in English: in addition to referring to all of Homo sapiens, it also can refer to the human condition or to the quality of being benevolent. What’s considered to be a linking thread for all of humanity in your conlang? What sorts of metaphorical extensions are there?

**Related words:** everyone, unity, mankind, species, world, universal, to be universal, to share.
