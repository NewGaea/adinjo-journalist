For Day One of Lexember, we'll be talking about the great things of Beyond. Essentially every world culture is obsessed with the universe their planet occupies as a vast area of intrigue and wonder. People have dedicated decades to learning its mysteries, but language has no time to wait for that before it begins to develop words for the objects in the night sky. So, let's talk about todayâ€™s topic, THE COSMOS.

Today's spotlight concepts are:

## SUN

**Related Words:** to rise, to set, to shine, to warm up, to guide, to give life, to dry out, deadly lazer, day, time, light, bright, fire, god, sky.

## MOON
