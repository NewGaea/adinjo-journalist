Today’s theme is the BODY. Since everyone has a body, they can be a rich source of inspiration for idioms and metaphors. After all, if someone says something is a pain in the neck, anyone with a neck can relate. Here are a few prompts to rack your brain about bodily things. Try your hand a few metaphors or idioms too!

## HAND

_el, nsa, iishaaly, čič, ruka, mon_

Those things at the end of your arms. You know, the ones I’m typing this with? They’ve (usually) got five little wiggly bits on the end. Some languages don’t have a separate word for this (for example “ruka” above covers the arms and hands together). What do your conlangs call these weird things? In English, hands often denote involvement or control. Are there any idioms in your conlang involving hands?

**Related words:** arms, wrists, fingers, knuckles, palm (of your hand), thumb, pinky, to point, paw, talon, hoof, leaf, gloves, ring, to make a fist, to hold, left- or right-handed, and uh...handy, or uh...handsome...

## HEAD

_rēšu, kuŋo, atsii’, niaquq, hoved_

The ol’ brainbox. Heads are very important to humans and other animals because they not only house our brains but all of our sensory organs too. They often have metaphorical connotations with things like importance and leadership. What kinds of connotations do your speakers have with the head? Do they have different words for different parts of it? Pervasive metaphors?

**Related words:** face, eyes, ears, mouth, jaw, teeth, forehead, nose, hair, skull, brain, to see, to hear, to think, to nod, in front, forward, on top (of).

## BLOOD

_darah, demm, daaʔ, nziaamv, krv, crúor_

It’s thicker than water. The liquid that gives us life, blood is often used as a metaphor for life itself. How do your conspeakers see blood? Is it a font of energy? Something to be spilled in battle? The tie that binds kin?

**Related words:** pulse, heart, vein, artery, to bleed, to flow, to cut, bloody.

## STOMACH

_zgrof, bibid, mave, dungus, betong, isisu_

Allen’s puns make me sick to it. In English, the digestive tract is used in a lot of metaphors around intuitive feelings and (more understandably) appetite. What does the stomach mean to your speakers? How about the gut? Are there specific words for different parts of the gut? If your conlang is made with some other world or non-human species in mind, what words do they have for their digestive apparati?

**Related words:** belly, abdomen, tripe, gut, intestines, hunger, to be hungry, to crave, to rumble (of your stomach), to digest, hungry, nauseous.

## TO HEAL

_whakamahu, hampiy, lečiti, medcur, darmân kardan_

I wish us all some healing during this time. The ability to self-protect and self-heal is one of the most amazing things our biology can do. How do your speakers discuss healing and medicine? What kinds of means of healing are available to them and what kinds of words do they have for them?

**Related words:** to heal someone (transitive), to heal/get better from something (intransitive), health, medicine, to treat, to cure, immune system, wound, sickness, scars, sick, healthy.
