We’re all in this together! Today, we’ll be discussing KINSHIP, which is a very interesting topic, cross-linguistically, because there is a surprising amount of variation in how different languages and cultures understand the family. Check out the Wikipedia page for kinship terminology for some basic information about that. And, once you’re a little familiar with the family, come back here and show us your new words!

## PARENT

_agunex, papabos, dzenitori, lwalidin, aesijiti, oi_

Love ‘em or hate ‘em, we’ve all got ‘em. Many languages distinguish parental terms by gender, and some of them colexify with “aunt/uncle” (particularly those cultures where aunts and uncles tend to be a lot closer with their nieces/nephews and play a larger role in caring for them). Are there any diminutive forms of these words (e.g., Mother > Mommy)? What types of roles do parents have in the family? You can also use these terms to refer to the causes or sources of something.

**Related Words:** aunt/uncle, grandparent, source, cause, original version, ancestor, mentor, master, guru, priest, to raise, to care for, to teach, to discipline, to lead.

## OFFSPRING

_mna, agac, mangisboahtti, tada, konsau, inti_

Again, many languages separate offspring terms by gender (e.g., English “son” and “daughter”), while some may apply the terms to nieces and nephews as well. What types of roles do children have in the family? Are families typically large or small? In a similar vein as PARENT, this term can also refer to the result or outcome of something.

**Related Words:** child, step-child, baby, newborn, grandchild, nephew/niece, descendants, infertile/childless, result, new version, apprentice, slave, student, to grow up, to need attention/care, to follow.

## SIBLING

_oyakx, engelyaalenga, syskon, mianadahy, vatsiats, bibimi_

Again, sibling terms can be distinguished by gender and include one’s cousins, but you can also have different terms for younger and older siblings. These terms can also be used to refer to a close friend or a fellow participant in one’s religion/philosophy. What kind of relationship do most siblings in your conculture have?

**Related Words:** cousin, twins, half-sibling, friend, peer, citizen, guest, member, to play, to associate (with), to live with.

## SPOUSE

_zawj, niwiidigemaagan, srɔ̃, céile, nhà, agóm_

The idea of marriage is rather ubiquitous in human cultures, but there are many different ideas about what it is and what its purpose is, so there’s a lot to think about. In some languages, the words for spouses colexify with the general gendered term (e.g., “husband” = “my man.”) Any gender roles may also influence the meaning of these words and how they’re used. What are some terms that relate to marriage ceremonies or artifacts?

**Related Words:** married person, partner, boyfriend/girlfriend, sexual partner, ex-spouse, wedding, matrimony, single, to marry, to divorce, to love, to be with, to be in a relationship with, to date/court.

## FAMILY

_sitaaneelvvi, hogasui, mispoxe, marafi, kutumba, va_

A collection of related people, typically consisting of at least one parent and their children. This often colexifies with “house” or “clan.” In English, there’s often a distinction between immediate and extended family, but in some cultures it’s normal for grandparents and aunt/uncles to live together. In-laws also play a number of roles in different cultures either as bad luck or as people to impress or honor.

**Related Words:** group, ancestry, in-laws, step-family, house, clan, to gather, to share, to be together, to be related to.
