Yum! Everybody’s gotta eat. And drink: hydrate or diedrate! FOOD & DRINK are important, daily, and culturally dependent, so they’re often very closely tied in with particular cultures and lifestyles. I’ve tried to pick fairly culturally neutral prompts, but feel free to use these as a springboard to dive as deep as you want into the foodways of your speakers!

## TEA

_chai, lahpet, herbata, dééh, chàh, chaayuq_

It’s the second most common drink on Earth, after water! Do your speakers drink much tea? What kinds? If they don’t, this is also a great time to think about other sorts of hot or infused beverages: herbal teas/tisanes, coffee, or even hot chocolate! Many cultures have rituals associated with these warm, stimulating beverages. Do yours?

**Related words:** herbal tea/infusion/tisane, coffee, hot chocolate, green tea, black tea, oolong, tea leaves, coffee beans, tea ceremony, to drink warm things, to brew, to steep, to strain, to boil, warming, comforting, invigorating.

## STEW

_āyōtl, atoo’, gulasz, jjigae, yakhni, cozido_

To make stew, you take stuff...and you cook it...for a while. This is a great way to handle a lot of different ingredients, and really give those flavors time to get to know each other. What do you call dishes like this? Do you have different kinds of dish like this or distinguish different important parts or components?

**Additional words:** soup, broth, to simmer, to braise, to stew, to cook, pot, pan, leftovers.

## FLATBREAD

_naan, tortilla, jianbing, roti, lavash, injera_

Just about every culture has some form of this. You grind up some kind of grain to make a batter, then you can ferment it if you want, and then spread it out and bake/fry/steam/cook it. You can stuff fillings in it, cover it with toppings, wrap it around something, or just go to town. Do your speakers have something like this? What do they make it with and how? What dishes do they use it in? All of the words for this one are specific kinds of flatbread or flatbread-based dishes from around the world—google ‘em for some inspiration!

**Additional words:** flour, grain, rice, corn, wheat, filling, wraps, leavening, griddle, to bake, to fry, to steam, to ferment.

## SWEETS

_ḥalwayāt, doces, gula-gula, caramelos, dipompong, snobberij_

I don’t know about you but I have a sweet tooth. Even just the mention of caramelos has my mouth watering. What sorts of sweets do your confolks have? What are common elements? Do they have certain contexts where sweets are appropriate? Concepts like Western “dessert” or American “breakfast” (cause let’s be real American breakfast can get pretty darn sugary). Or are sweets mainly eaten as a snack or interspersed with other parts of the meal?

**Additional words:** sugar, syrup, fruit, cookies, biscuits, dessert, snack, to bake, to macerate, to sweeten, to caramelize, sweet.

## BON APPETIT

_buen provecho, hoi fan lah, itadakimasu, ju bëftë mirë, ellerine sağlık, bone apple teeth_

No, not the magazine, but have you seen what Sohla’s been up to lately? A lot of languages around the world have a word or phrase to say before you eat. These range from wishing people an enjoyable meal to expressing gratitude for the food to telling people to dig right in. A lot of these are more set phrases than literal translations. I mean heck, in English we just say it in French. What do you say in your conlang? Are there other rituals around eating?

**Additional words:** to dig in, to enjoy, appetite, to begin a meal, meal, service, grace, blessings.
