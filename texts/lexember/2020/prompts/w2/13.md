One of the things that set humans apart from the rest of the animal kingdom was our profound ability to make and use TOOLS. We’ve come a long way, from sharp sticks to power tools, but no matter the era or the culture, humans everywhere have always used all sorts of different tools, and that’s what we’re going to be looking at today!

Today’s spotlight concepts are:

## FLINT

_tecpatl, silex, qaddāḥ, cakmak, panting_

We use tools to shape the world around us, but in order to do that, we need something that’s harder and more durable than that which we wish to work on. One of the most ancient materials used in tools has been stone, flint being especially common in some parts of the world.

Do your speakers use flint as their primary material for tools? Or are they past the stone age? If so, what is their primary material? What is the terminology surrounding work with said material?

**Additional words:** knap, obsidian, edge, sharp, bronze, copper, iron, steel

## KNIFE

_kwar’o, wila, aizto, thok, bıçaq, pisau_

Whether to cut vines, skin animals, or carve wood, knives are crucial to our everyday lives no matter where or when we’re from. The concept is simple: A small blade made of some hard and durable material mounted on a handle.

What kinds of different knives do your speakers have for different tasks? What do they call them? What do your speakers call the different components of a knife?

**Additional words:** cut, blade, handle, sword, sheath, razor, shaver

## AXE

_waagaakwad, k’acha, ähšš, wókka, balta, umbagong_

Just like the knife, axes are present in almost every single culture with some kind of tool use. At its core, the axe is simple, as it usually consists of a long handle with some kind of sharpened, hard head fastened in one end.

What types of different axes do your speakers use? Do they prefer certain species of wood for the handle? Are axes used for something other than chopping wood, such as warfare?

**Additional words:** wood, lumber, lumberjack, battle axe

## NEEDLE

_awóoha, púuts’, nēþla, kusona, kem, dagum_

We’re moving away from the generally destructive tools and looking at a type of tool that is almost universally present in any culture that produces clothing.

Made of virtually any hard material, be it bone, wood, keratin, or metal, a needle is made to draw a thread through some kind of material without damaging said material more than necessary.

What do your speakers call a needle? Are there different types of needles for different materials? Do your speakers use needles for anything other than producing clothing? Perhaps needles are for tattooing as well? Stitching wounds?

**Additional words:** sew, thread, stitch, tattoo

## SHOVEL

_hele, saru, kuaiva, gotto, kep, hāpara_

This one can get very, very complicated or very, very simple – and everything in between. Because what is a shovel, other than a tool to move material from one place to another?

In Neolithic times, the shoulder blades of large animals were commonly used as “proto-shovels”, then later on people began crafting purposefully built shovels. In modern times, we’ve got a whole range of different tools originating from the same concept. Think spades, trowels, gardening spades, spatulae, snow shovels, etc.

What sorts of distinctions do your speakers make between these different tools? Maybe none at all? As with the above words, think of the materials your speakers have at their disposal. Maybe your speakers are so technologically advanced that they have machinery to do the hard work for them?

**Additional words:** spade, gravel, snow shovel, trowel, dustpan
