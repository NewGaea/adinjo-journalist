No matter the climate you live in, today’s topic is an almost undeniable part of your life: CLOTHING. Your clothes keep you warm, they protect you from the elements, they can even be stylish, they can be an expression of your personality, and they can convey your social status to others.

Today we’ll be looking at some of the different techniques and materials associated with the making of clothing!

Today’s spotlight concepts are:

## SKIN

_ikał, qara, bian, meska, ewe, kiri_

The connection is logical: It protects and keeps animals warm, so it should do the same to us, obviously! As long as you’re good at hunting, animal skins are an available and reliable source of cover for your body which does just what it’s supposed to.

Do your speakers have words for the skins of different animals? What’s the terminology behind working with skins? Are they used in certain types of clothing?

**Related words:** skin (v.), flay, pelt, fur, leather, skin of a fruit, leather, to tan, to cure.

## WEAVE

_ihquiti, yatana, tkát, ukuluka, uz, hatu_

One of the oldest ways of producing fabric is weaving. This is most commonly done with a kind of loom or some other device that stretches out rows of thread.

Do your speakers weave? What kinds of things do they weave? Do they have different types of looms? Is weaving only for clothing or do they also produce tapestries and other solely decorative pieces of fabric? Also consider how the thread is produced.

**Related words:** loom, tapestry, knot, braid, warp, weft, pattern, thread, fabric.

## KNIT

_hacer punto, tricotar, örmek, ḥāka, thó, manao ba_

A slightly more complicated technique that isn’t as inherently obvious as some other methods of producing clothing, knitting is done by creating interlocking loops of yarn in a specific pattern and system with a type of needle.

Do your speakers knit? What sorts of techniques do they use? Do they crochet, using a single needle, or do they knit with two needles at once? Do they have traditional textural patterns? Color patterns?

**Additional words:** needle, crochet, sweater, scarf, to knit, to purl, to stitch, a stitch, yarn.

## SEW

_náʼáłkad, umaka, cosir, kushona, kemeyki, humuhumu_

Humans have been sewing since the Paleolithic, way before anyone began weaving, and way, way before anyone ever thought of knitting! Sewing involves a type of needle with which you puncture fabric or hide, drawing a string through it, and connecting it to other pieces of fabric/hide.

What is the terminology surrounding sewing in your conlang? Do your speakers have different words for sewing with different types of string/material? What do they call their different types of needles? Is it done by hand, or do they have access to technology that allows them to make sewing machines?

**Related words:** sewing machine, sewing needle, tailor, seamstress, thread, to hem, to stitch, to remove threads.

## CLOTHING

_ilokfa, uška, tøj, fini, baṭṭalu, ‘ofu_

Now that we know which techniques and technologies your speakers have access to, it’s time to determine what kinds of clothing they have – and more importantly, what your speakers call them!

Do men and women dress differently? What about children/adults? Does clothing indicate your status? Your profession? What types of pieces of clothing are there? Are there certain cultural rules that prohibit people from wearing certain types of clothes?

**Related words:** shirt, pants, skirt, dress, shoe, hat, glove, undergarments, sock, jewelry, naked.
