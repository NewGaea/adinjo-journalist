Home is where the heart is and it’s at the core of so much that we do, especially now, given the state of the world. That’s why today’s special flavor is the HOUSE. We sleep in it, we work in it, we live in and out of it. And for that reason, let’s give it some love.

We’ll be looking at different rooms or sections of the home a couple steps back into the abstract, because not every home is built the same or is stacked together from the same rooms.

Today’s spotlight concepts are:

## ENTRYWAY

_antre, kirish joyi, abawọle, lối vào, ieeja_

Does the home of your average speaker’s home have an entry hall or is it more like mine where it consists of a spot to put shoes and then just the rest of the home? Do they have coat closets or benches for people to wait to be met by the ladies and lords of the manor?

Tell us about the first few steps into someone’s home!

**Related words:** front door, mud-room, doormat, doorbell, hat hook, to enter, threshold, to come home.

## COMMUNAL SPACE

_oturma otağı, stue, ini, rūma noho, sebule_

All my life I’ve been in homes that have had living rooms, though when I’d visit friends, I’d also hear them referred to as salons, greeting rooms and sunrooms. This is the place in the house where you’d entertain guests or hang out as a home unit. Clearly it’s also not limited to just the rooms I’ve listed; folks have TV rooms, rec rooms, man caves, theaters, bars and parlours.

We’d like to hear about the kinds of rooms that your speakers spend a lot of time in. Do they have separate rooms for family as opposed to guests? Is the climate such that they kick it outside around an impluvium?

**Related words:** couch, dining table, lounge, guest, terrace, patio, to relax, to invite, to gather.

## KITCHEN

_kombuis, sukalde, rannaghôr, dzodoƒe, igaffik_

By far my favorite part of any house, the kitchen is a surefire place to learn a lot about someone. Currently, I’ve got an apartment which has a gas stove and oven, a sink, a fridge and a few cabinets, but I’ve been to places where there are magnetic bars for knives on the wall, cutting boards and garbage disposals built into their countertops, wine fridges, separate faucets for water purifiers, samovars–the variations are endless, honestly.

What could we expect to see in the average kitchen of one of your speakers? How about someone who’s poured their wages into getting a top of the line kitchen? Does the style of food preparation require them to have specific types of cooking implements?

**Related words:** to prepare food, platter, skillet, refrigerator, microwave, kettle, scullery.

## PERSONAL QUARTERS

_aposentos privadas, fale tumaoti, efitrano manokana, robo za kibinasfi, katye prive_

They’re the places we retire to when we’re wanting time alone or to work on our hobbies. It’s also where we sleep. Personal quarters like a bedroom, study or workshop are an integral part of a home space.

Maybe your speakers all have personal libraries with their favorite texts. Or maybe they’re a religious bunch and have a space dedicated to worship. Wherever it is that they fallback to, tell us about it!

**Related words:** bed, blanket, nursery, decanter, bookshelf, carpet, conservatory, to sleep, to spend time alone.

## STORAGE

_chanm depo, saqlash xonasi, storij plats, igumbi lokugcina, bantob phtok_

Homes often have places to keep the things we acquire over the course of our lives. For some people, there’s a dedicated space like an attic or a basement. For others, they might use closets or furniture as their go-to places to stuff belongings. It’s not always just for tchotchke either–sometimes you need a place to keep food like a pantry or a root cellar. If folks live on a vineyard, they’ve likely got a wine cellar. If they’re like me, maybe they’ve got a ridiculous wall with holes drilled through for their absurd quantities of herb and spice bottles.

Tell us about where your speakers keep their belongings. If they’ve got any unique uses for the places between livable spaces, all the better!

**Related words:** crawlspace, shed, barn, broom closet, loft, safe, to store, to keep, to hide, to stash.
