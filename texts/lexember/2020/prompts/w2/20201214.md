Where did he come from? Where did he go? And how did he get there? Today, our topic is on MOTION, with special attention drawn to motion verbs. There are several ways that language can lexicalize motion, motion+manner, motion+direction, and motion+patient being the most common. So it’s time to get your brain turning and your fingertips slapping to create some new words!

## TO GO

_hele, cim, istsi, vashara, ale, poi_

In other words, to move oneself from Point A to Point B. If Point B is “here,” then you’d use come, or if point B is over there you’d say “leave.” If you’re going with your legs, you’d say “walk” unless you were walking really fast in which you’d say “run.” But not all creatures who go fast on legs run. Sometimes they “scurry!” There are all different types of going! How does going work in your conlang?

**Related words:** to come/arrive/enter, to leave/exit, to walk, to slide, to slither, to hop, to tiptoe, to run, to skip, to scoot, to march, to go through, to go in, to go out, to go around, to go forward, to go backward, to go sideways

## TO MOVE

_kɛíst, modan, bewegen, bal, di chuyển, rue_

As in, transitively, to move something (that isn’t yourself) from Point A to Point B. Some languages famously have different words depending on the shape or structure of what’s being moved (e.g., moving a thin rope-like object vs. moving a heavy rock-like object.) There are also a lot of different types of movement such as pushing, pulling, putting on, taking off, picking up, and letting go… Lots of options here!

**Related Words:** to carry, to transport, to send, to reposition, to organize, to drag, to roll, to mix, to take, to bring

## TO HIT

_del, phota, trefel, tsa, pukul, pazovo_

This is the act of coming in quick, forceful contact with something. There are many reasons why you would want to hit something: maybe you’re hitting a ball with a bat, nails with a hammer, idiots with a chair… anyway. Again, terms can be different based on the force of the hit, what’s being hit, and what tools are being used to hit with.

**Related Words:** to tap, to smack, to crush, to swing, to crack, to hurt/injure, to bang, to pound, to strike, to hit with an object, to hit a person, to hit me baby one more time, to high-five

## TO CUT

_chukta, yiset, kovo, ihengga, tuje, inytyi_

The act of cutting - or separating - is all over our everyday lives. We cut our nails and hair, our fields and lawns, our food, our materials, and sometimes each other. Typically, this involves a tool with a sharp edge (e.g., a knife or scissors), but you can still “rip” or “tear” something for the same (albeit less precise) effect. Just like the earlier words, “to cut” can have different terms depending on what is being cut and/or what tools are used to cut.

**Related Words:** to separate, to mow, to sheathe, to cut hair, to chop, to split, to break, to crack, to cut in half, to cut into many pieces, to shred, to stab, to slit, to carve

## TO DO

_baanunk, rurana, fazer, kola, o, nohor_

This is a very broad term that generally means to “bring about,” “make happen,” or “perform an action,” and a lot of languages colexify this with “to make” and “to work.” You have a lot of freedom with this one.

**Related Words:** to produce, to engage, to participate, to have an occupation in, to act, to behave, to have a habit, to build, to not do, to abstain, to avoid.
