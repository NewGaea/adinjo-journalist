Today’s prompt is something we’ve given a lot of thought to: thought itself! Today we’re talking about COGNITION. Cogitamus ergo sumus. Let’s all give this a good cogitation today.

Today’s spotlight concepts are:

## IDEA

_naleb, manau, zungu, lide, buddhi, myslenka_

There are all different kinds of ideas. Good ones, bad ones, ones that make you wonder whether you were even thinking at all. You can have complicated ideas with farfetched plans or simple ones that are just an image, words, or even a smell. Smells are pretty dang complicated too. What sorts of words are there for different kinds of ideas, the act of having them, or people who have them?

**Related Words:** to think, to occur (to someone), imaginary, imagination, thought, thoughtful, creative, abstract.

## TO KNOW

_kanunsath, nyindi, dikat, a fhios a bheith ag, rina, ji dou_

To have justified true belief...or something. You might not realize it, but the English word ‘know’ is a bit polysemous. It covers ideas like “be aware of a piece of information,” “be familiar with a person or place,” and “have sufficient knowledge to perform an action” (not to mention its biblical sense). Many languages split up different kinds of knowing. Does yours?

**Related Words:** to know (someone), to know (a fact), to know (how to do something), to know (biblically), knowledge, belief, to believe, to learn, to teach, known, true, clear.

## TO CONSIDER

_atedelix, teha, pinsa, dysynmek, fekr kardan, mwailana_

In order to think, you have to think about something. What sorts of mundane considerations and philosophical musings occupy the minds of people who use your conlang to think them over? Do you have words for thinking about something as opposed to thinking that something is the case? What about thinking good or bad thoughts about something?

**Related Words:** reflections, considerations, to think about, thoughtful, :pensive:, to think positively/negatively, to overthink, to wonder, curiosity.

## TO LIKE

_gostar de, mesetylix, ikunda, jungyih, dust dâstan, stikuna_

What do your speakers like? What’s their favorite part of that thing? How do they express it verbally? Since ‘liking’ is such a common thing to talk about, this one’s prone to having a lot of idioms or periphrastic expressions. While searching I found expressions for “X likes Y” that translate literally to “Y pleases X,” “Y is good with X,” “X enjoys from Y,” “from Y comes the good of X,” “X has a friend Y,” “X has love for Y,” “Y pleases itself to X,” and “X hits wish Y.” How does your language frame experiencing emotions like “liking” something? Do experiencers tend to pattern like subjects? Do they pattern like objects with the thing they’re experiencing as the subject? Are experiencers said to have or contain their experiences?

**Related Words:** preference, to dislike, to love, pleasure, to please, good, bad.

## TO WANT

_mau, is mian le, kusaka, kwii, stahlaa, istämäk_

Another one with a lot of idioms. How badly do you want this? Is it a light hankerin’ or a mighty need? How do you express all the different degrees and reasons you might want something? Is there a difference between talking about wanting to do something, wanting someone else to do something, and wanting an object? Can you talk about what other people want directly or do you have to express other peoples’ internal desires indirectly?

**Related Words:** wish, desire, need, to hanker for, to feel like (doing something), to hope for, to choose, desirable, wanted, greedy.
