It’s time to open up and talk about our feelings because our topic for today is EMOTION. There are a lot of different emotions that humans can feel, and there are only so many words we can use to describe them. Today, we’re going to look at five of the most basic and universal human emotions according to Disney Pixar’s Inside Out psychologists.

## HAPPY

## ANGRY

Do they try to suppress it or do they let it take over. If it depends, what does it depend on?

## AFRAID

_yu’íi, kirikip, ouhtasth, gəɓar, khasas, barrari_

What things make your conlang’s speakers afraid? Fear often triggers our “fight or flight (or freeze)” response whenever we perceive something that might be dangerous. This response - tense muscles, alert mind, increased heart rate and respiration, etc. - help to get our body ready for survival. But there’s more than just temporary fear, there are also different phobias which are nagging and perpetual fears that we sometimes make as part of our identity. In many cultures, the ability to overcome fear - known as courage - is seen as a virtue, especially for warriors and first responders. How does your conculture understand fear and courage?

**Related Words:** to fight, to fly/flee, to freeze up, to sweat, to shiver/shake, to scream, to hide, to be afraid of something/have a phobia, to survive, crabs.

## DISGUSTED

_nooxgare, nurija, dégoûté, gársákâ, yeoggyeoun, whakahouhou_

What things make your conlang’s speakers disgusted (e.g., repeating the same questions over and over again)? The most common triggers for disgust are rotten foods, poor hygiene, and messy spaces, all of which threatens a human’s survival. Therefore, disgust plays a similar role as fear. Disgust can also be credited for creating cultural taboos around bodily functions (such as defecation) and diseases (especially infectious ones).

**Related Words:** to vomit, to turn away, to hold one’s nose, to close one’s eyes, to be rotten, to be old or out of date, to be unhealthy, to dislike, “ewwww.”
