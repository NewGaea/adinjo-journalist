Well here you are, it’s about time! No, really. For Lexember today, it’s about Time

Today’s spotlight concepts are:

## MINUTE

_t’ijuqa, hvilina, deqiqe, simili, fûnchûng, miniti_

In modern reckoning, we divide time into years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Some of these units are natural: days, months, and years all have to do with the motion of our solar system. Other units are totally arbitrary! It just so happens we settled on this 24-60-60 pattern a few thousand years ago in the Middle East. Other cultures have historically divided the day into a hundred kè, into thirty muhurta, and a whole slough of other units. What sorts of divisions do you use?

**Related Words:** second, hour, day, week, year, to divide, small time, short, quick, A.M., P.M.

## CLOCK

_uasi, sa’at, agogo, reloho, ceas, waac_

Watches, alarm clocks, hourglasses and sundials. How do your speakers tell time? What do clocks look like and what is their relationship with measured time? And most importantly, what’s the melting temperature of your clocks?

**Related Words:** digital clock, analog clock, watch, sundial, hands (of a clock), to tell time, tick, tock, alarm, gear, clockwork, stopwatch, timer, to time.

## TO PASS

_qangerpa, iragan, tatsu, muni, inqada, otu_

In English we have this metaphor that as time passes, we move forwards into the future and look backwards at the past. (Inexplicably as we move forward through time, time also moves forward past us?) But this doesn’t have to be the case: in Quechua, the future is behind you and the past is in front of you. The reasoning goes that you can’t see the future and you can’t see what’s behind you. In Chinese, earlier events are “above” and later events are “below.” What sorts of metaphors does your language use to talk about passage and position in time?

**Related Words:** to last, to spend (of time), to endure, long-lasting, quick, slow, timespan, length (of time), to be bored, pastime.

## NOON

_sakwiimak, avatea, matoroko, aangw, anjau, meda_

Noon is when the sun’s highest in the sky. It’s a natural dividing point in the day. What are some other natural dividing points in the day? Are there other culturally important points? How do your speakers divide the day and the night? What activities do people associate with those times?

**Related Words:** midday, to shine, zenith, afternoon, to get late, evening, dusk, sunset, to set (of the sun), night, midnight, nadir, twilight, dawn, sunrise, to rise (of the sun), to be early, morning, forenoon.

## FUTURE

_qhipa pacha, kiləçək, daakye, avni, kinabukasan, cionglai_

Now that you’ve decided whether the future is in front, behind, above, or below, you get to talk about what’s there. It’s unknowable and all that, but what do your speakers say is in the future? Do they have a utopian vision, an apocalyptic vision, or is everything just gonna loop around? Another thing to think about here is how your conlang treats tense. Is it marked? How? Do you distinguish future from present, or present from past? How many distinctions do you make?

**Related Words:** past, present, future, the distant future: the year 2000, chrome, eras, will, to be going to, future (adj).
