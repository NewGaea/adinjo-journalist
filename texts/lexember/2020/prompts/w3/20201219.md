We’ve talked about space insofar as the float beyond our atmosphere, but now it’s time to talk about the space those things occupy. How do we distinguish what we draw on paper from what we carve from stone from what we watch change over time? You’re in it and you’re out of it, let's talk about today’s topic, SPACE.

Enjoy today’s cross-section of semantic space:

## DIMENSION

_mitta, buʿd, sukod, niganvhisv, chisu_

We’re all familiar with lower dimensions: lines in the first, planes in the second, cubes in the third. But things can get crazy as more axes are added (see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4Gotl9vRGs). Do speakers of your language have terms to deal with naming shapes in these higher dimensions? Do they think about the nature of their own world and how many dimensions they live within?

**Related Words:** axis, length, width, depth, hypercube

## VOLUME

_caval, volim, bagtaamž, buok, umthamo_

When I moved into my apartment it became abundantly clear that years of Tetris were going to help me to make the most of my square-footage (despite underestimating it). Knowing the volume of a space is tremendously useful–it could mean a cozier home, a bigger coffee cup or how well illuminated your bedroom is when the power goes out. What do your speakers care about measuring?

**Related Words:** cup, liter, milliliter, gallon, teaspoon, tablespoon, lumen

## RITUAL SPACE

_rreth, dayira, diyosuun, gol, porowhita_

Whether the context is a religious ceremony, a high school graduation or the table for your Magic the Gathering game, there are rules that define that space. A friend of mine from college wrote his honors thesis about how games and religion share common ground by suspending the rules of reality as we know them to draw attention to what’s being performed within the ritual space.

Do the speakers of your language have a dice game that requires the use of a board? Do they protect their homes from evil spirits by burning sage bundles or encircling them in salt? Do they have rituals where the person leading the ritual says one thing and the audience knows they’re supposed to call back with something else?

**Related Words:** candle, incense, field of play, prayer, guide

## tRuThIsM

_cthulhu fhtagn, Aa, b̵̺̩̦͉͓̬̼͎̝̣̮̩̔̋̏̒̊͑̐͗̀̚̚͝͝͠ẽ̶̢̛͍̫͇̤̬͙̒͜ľ̶̮̤̪̝͛i̴͎͇̙̮̓̎e̷̙̘̤̭̼͓͖͒̑̓̈́̏͊͒̎͜v̶̱͉͕͉̰̪̮̥̲̳̲̈́̾̾͆̐ͅë̴̛͙̩̮̲̺̱̼̘̜́̋́́͒, “fire walk with me”_

Lurking on the weird part of Youtube, linked innocuously on reddit seemingly unrelated reddit posts, and available for purchase from numerous New Age stores one can find them–bits and pieces of “the Truth” with an intentional capital <t>. A recurring theme in many conspiracy theories and New Age beliefs is sacred geometry. This might surface as a hot take blending different meditative practices with Kabbalah, as with the Merkhaba in media about the Emerald Tablets of Thoth. It might also come up when discussing the phi ratio in relationship to everything from plant growth patterns, to ancient buildings, to which tones are musically “perfect” together. It might even be the space-time torus that we exist in or on.

Are there patterns your speakers recognize popping up in mundane things? Do they have alternate interpretations about the nature of their own existence when defined by mathematics? Do they live on a literal Earth donut?

**Related Words:** fractal, pi, dimensional frequency, tuning fork, ascension

## PERSONAL SPACE

_sīrén kōngjiān, henkilökohtainen tila, yegili bota, avanoa a le tagata lava ia, espas pèsonèl_

The last space we’re going to talk about is personal space, but we’re going to need to set some ground-rules first. It’s important you know that it might be personal space in the sense of setting boundaries with friends, family or coworkers. It also might be asking for a little wiggle room with your responsibilities. Honestly, it could just be that you need a little bit more privacy. In what sorts of ways do your speakers carve out the space they need to live and feel comfortable? Have they got words or idioms for when personal space is violated (“packed like sardines”)?

**Related Words:** breathing room, blacklist, private life, alone time, social sphere
