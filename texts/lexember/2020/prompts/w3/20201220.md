Whew, there have been so many of these prompts. The number on top says “20” but tbh I can’t count that high, so I’m not entirely sure how much that is. Maybe today I’ll learn to count that high, as we talk about NUMBERS & QUANTIFICATION.

Today’s spotlight concepts are:

## ONE

_ichi, kurni, ngwi, yak, maya, eden_

Let’s start at the very beginning. A very good place to start. How do you say one in your conlang? Are there different forms for counting and for saying there’s just one of something? Do you have special associations with one, unity, singleness?

**Related Words:** single, unity, to unite, a(n), [other indefinite markers], only, alone, few, to start, to be alone, first.

## TEN

_sahp, gubnan, kusok, dezmit, lajeeb, pamole_

Okay so you have one, but where do the numbers go from there? Most natural languages have counting systems with base-10 systems, since most humans count on their 10 fingers and all. How do you build multiples of ten and larger numbers? Do you have any words for groups of numbers in addition to the numbers themselves? Duos and dozens might be familiar from English, but there’s others. French has dizaine for a group of 10, for example. Are any numbers considered lucky?

While you’re at it, give your numbers from 1-10 if you can! Make u/janko_gorenc12 proud.

**Related Words:** tenth, dozen, decade, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, you know I could go on all day...

## TO COUNT

_tatau, dimpata, tangdzami, rekna, gin, tupaco_

This is the first math we all learn. Enumerating is a useful skill whether you’re counting sheep or calculating orbital trajectories. How do your concultures do it? Do you have a way of counting on your hands? Growing up in the US, I learned to count starting from my index finger, and later on in school learned the ASL signs for 6-10. I stayed in Europe for a bit, where I learned that I had been wrong! You’re supposed to start counting on your thumb. Now I’ve learned from my Asian partner that really, I should have been using these single-hand gestures all along! The real moral of the story is that wherever you go in the world, you’ll find new ways of counting on your hands.

**Related Words:** to enumerate, amount, count, (un)countable, numerous, infinite, many, to increase, to add, to subtract, to multiply, to divide.

## ALL

_lewi, apau, hashkana, enkerr, ymmut, sve_

All of something is every single one or every last bit. How do you express that something is true of every single thing of a certain type in your conlang? Are there different ways to talk about the entireties of mass nouns and count nouns? Do you have distributive words like “each” and “every”?

**Related Words:** each, every, entire, entirety, total, totality, to complete, to cover, to fill, to represent, universal, everything, everywhere, everybody.

## NONE

_hich, sifiri, noa, aska, nulla, bomi_

What’s the opposite of everything? Nothing! Now it’s time to think about nothing (which is honestly something I do quite often). How do you say that something is true of no members of a particular group? Do you have a quantifier that modifies nouns? A way of saying that members of the group with some quality don’t exist? Some other construction? How do your speakers treat nothingness? Do they have a mathematical concept of zero?

**Related Words:** zero, zip, zilch, nada, none, not, void, empty, to empty, to be worthless, to be null, nobody, nowhere, nothing.
