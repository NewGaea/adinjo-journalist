The greatest of human inventions and the object of every conlanger’s affections… today’s topic is all about **SPEECH & LANGUAGE**. Today, we’ll be talking about language in general and the four primary ways that we use language in communication. There’s quite a bit to think about since there can be a lot of variations in how a language separates these different actions.

## LANGUAGE

_oqatsit, cicam, ligwa, harshee, thun, faahingalea_

How do your conlang’s speakers separate languages from dialects from accents from idiolect? Are some dialects more prestigious than others? Do they have any contact with speakers from other languages? What do they call their own language? Many times, the word for language colexifies with the word for “tongue,” “word,” “voice,” or “mouth.”

**Related words:** dialect, accent, tongue, word, sentence, speech, voice, mouth, grammar, lexicon, symbol, conlang, sign language, jargon, code, to communicate, bilingual/multilingual, linguistics.

## TO SPEAK

_tynokhtelix, kutana, avorbi, koze, itakpa, dhungayi_

Speech words refer to the act of producing language, whether by voice or by sign. Are there distinct terms depending on the arguments of the verb (e.g., ‘to talk’ is intransitive, ‘to say’ is transitive)? What types of speaking does your language have distinctions for (e.g., “describe,” “whisper,” “insult,” etc.)?

**Related words:** to ask, to answer, to announce, to preach/speak publically, to pray, to sing, to pronounce, to laugh, to exhale, to exclaim, to scream/yell, to be silent/quiet, to withhold/keep secret, to slip up, to stutter, to be mute

## TO LISTEN

_abink, yapiaka, iskutar, reetsa, long, tyendak_

Listening words refer to an act of hearing spoken language (or seeing signed languages) and understanding the message. Naturally, there are fewer possibilities for “listen” compared to “speak,” but you could still make distinctions between how actively someone is listening or whether or not they understand what’s being said. This often co-lexifies with “understand” and “obey” and, especially, “hear.”

Something else to think about is backchannelling, which are small interjections that speakers use to let a speaker know that they are listening to what they’re saying. What backchannels, verbal or non-verbal, exist in your conlang?

**Related words:** ear, to understand, to obey, to hear, to pay attention, to not listen, to ignore, to be deaf, “What?”, to respond

## TO WRITE

_ozhibii'ige, ika, kirjutada, keleri, sumulat, tusi_

Writing words refer to the act of producing language through marks on a surface. This is a literary skill, and not all cultures use writing (although it has become much more common nowadays). Comparatively, writing is a recent invention, but we do have a wealth of different ways we can talk about it. Are there different words for writing with different utensils? Writing for oneself vs. writing for other people? Also think about how your speakers write? Writing requires a utensil (pencil, stylus, finger, etc.) and a surface (paper, clay, sand, etc.), what’s your culture’s preferred method? Does everyone know how to write, or is it only available to certain classes of people?

**Related words:** writing utensil, writing surface, alphabet, calligraphy, orthography, neography, to draw, to carve, to print, to stamp, to mark, to type, to write a letter/essay/proclamation, to trace, to sign/place signature, to draft, to revise, to transcribe, to record/note, to publish

## TO READ

_ółtaʼ, monee, lenna, manbäb, kan, riitimma_

Reading verbs refer to the act of understanding written language. Since it’s more passive than writing, there tend to be fewer distinctions in reading terms. What kinds of things do your speakers read, and are there distinct terms for what a person is reading or how they’re reading it? Like writing, reading can be restricted to certain classes of people.

**Related words:** book, scroll, letter, declaration, sign, text, to comprehend, to skim, to scan, to study, to decipher, to read out loud, to check, to look over, to count
