Yesterday we talked about GOVERNMENT & POLITICS, the systems that our nations live by. Today we’re talking about what we hope against hope that those systems lead to: LAW & JUSTICE.

Today’s spotlight concepts are:

### LAW

_nomos, akuwaipa, sakon, kotmaja, yikre, hukum_

Laws are a set of formalized customs that determine what you can and can’t do in a particular society. Some places have their laws written down in a code, so you can look up what it says. Other places treat the law as a body of tradition, and look back to previous decisions to see what the law really means. Some places have multiple parallel sets of laws, maybe a religious set and a secular set, or a local set and a national set. What sorts of laws does your conculture have and how are they kept track of?

**Related Words:** rule, ordinance, to enact, to legislate, to allow, to forbid, legal, illegal, legislator, formal, to obey, to follow (a rule), to be allowed (according to the rules).

### RIGHT

_yanydya, norche, iluarpoq, spravni, barabara, mikrlae_

Here I don’t mean “right” as in “not left” but “right” as in “not wrong.” How do you decide what the right thing to do is? Do your speakers have some sort of ethical code they abide by? Most importantly, if there was a conculturally appropriate transportation vehicle careening towards five of your speakers, would another of your speakers divert it to only hit one?

(In English, we also have polysemy with “right” as in “things a member of a society is entitled to.” That’s also relevant for today, so tell me about rights and duties too, if you feel so moved.)

**Related Words:** just, correct, to do what’s right, a good deed, noble, virtuous, true, correct, wrong, bad, evil, to do wrong, to sin, ethics, ethical code.

### CORRUPTION

_tānwū, fesaad, rasuah, koripsyon, musuqmaasaq, para aluu_

Sometimes greed and personal desire get in the way of law and justice. This can be big, like selling off permits for billion-dollar national projects, or it can be small, like the time I paid a…uh…minor convenience fee to a border guard who told me my passport wasn’t a valid photo ID… What forms can corruption take among your speakers and what (if anything) do they do to fight it? Are there any informal ways to grease the wheels, to sweeten the deal, or to speed things along?

**Related Words:** corrupt, a corrupt official, bribery, to bribe, scandal, kickback, to deal under the table, underground economy.

### TO JUDGE

_kara ndzu, tayab, vae, drɔ̃ ʋɔnu, døma, aymex_

In order to turn laws into justice, someone’s gotta decide what the appropriate justice is. What’s the name for that process? What’s taken into account? What do you call the different portions of that process, like gathering evidence, interrogating witnesses, or making the final decision? Who makes the decision in the end? An individual judge, a jury, a council?

**Related Words:** to decide, to pass judgment, judgment, innocent, guilty, verdict, to proclaim, court, courtroom, decided, to concur, to dissent, defense, rebuttal, cross-examine, witness.

### A JUDGE

_akute, kues, phuaphaksaa, sobuteri, kadhi, judecator_

The noun this time, not the verb! I’m not here to judge you, but someone is. Who is that person? How do they get to be in their position? In my country there are some who are voted for by the people and some who are chosen by the government. Some places they might be elders, religious appointees, or even lucky recipients of a hereditary position. Are there names for different levels of judge, like how we call supreme court members “justices” in the US? What does it take to become a judge in your conculture?

**Related Words:** jury, executioner, bench, gavel, robes, wigs (for some reason?), lawyer, council, elder, judicial, trial, defendant, hung (of a jury).
