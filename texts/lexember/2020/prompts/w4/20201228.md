Another day, another collection of concepts to inspire your creativity. In keeping with that, we’re hopeful that we’ve gotten your creative juices flowing because today is all about ART. There’s obviously some debate as to what can be considered art and since you’ve all been working on your languages, which are definitely art of a kind, we’re going to focus on visual arts.

### ILLUSTRATION

_kuvituskuva, chātú, naʼachʼąąh, çizim, pikitia whakaari_

Whether cave paintings, etchings or full on pen and ink illustrations, the practice of putting contrasting substances on a canvas (in the general sense) is a classic form of self-expression.

Do people who speak your language paint? Do they have cartoons in publications or on television? Have they got their own traditional methods with inks made from pigments and carriers native to their world? Tell us about them!

**Additional words:** ink, paint, brush, canvas, primer, graffiti, marker, pen, charcoal, chalk, paper, spray-paint

### SCULPTURE

_heykəltəraşlıq, szobrászat, điêu khắc, farshaxan, porãguerojera_

Functional to fantastical, sculptures allow people to recreate in 3D space the things they see or dream up. Carved from stone, molded from clay or shaped with shears, there’s seemingly no limit to the means and materials used in sculpting a work of art.

Do your speakers pride themselves on bowls, cups and pitchers that they create? Do they erect effigies that act as stand-ins for deities or forces of nature? Have they got a history of stacking stones of varying size?

**Additional words:** marble, stone, chisel, effigy, platform, hedge, statue, pottery, pottery wheel

### ARCHITECTURE

_adanelanvhi, ilusilersugaaneq, handasa, ailtireacht, sthaaptaʼyaʼkam_

Whether classical like the Colosseum or Lalibela, or more modern like Philip Johnson’s Glass House or the Şakirin Mosque, architecture is a form of art that inspires passersby and tourists alike. There are movements like minimalism to explore in material, design or size (see tiny houses) and things from the natural world to be emulated, as is the case with some bermed homes.

How do the speakers of your language express themselves through construction? Have they erected monuments to wars or movements? Are cities planned in such a way that they become works of art themselves?

**Additional words:** brick, cement, steel, structure, scaffolding, monument, memorial, tourist destination, architect, blueprint, engineer

### FOLK ART

_tyeji, umanút, shugei, mea taulima, umsebenzi wezandla_

Traditional crafts from various cultures are also prized as works of art. From weaved baskets with intricate patterns that still maintain their strength, to glass trinkets which serve as charms, any tool can be turned into art with a little thought and a little know-how.

Do your speakers get giddy over gilded utensils? Or maybe wax figurines leave them wide-eyed and full of wonder? Think about what traditional crafts could be considered art.

**Additional words:** antique, geegaw, flatware, stoneware, carpet, tapestry, refurbish, craftsperson, idol

### MODERN ART

_tanamedrove khelovneba, celf fodern, zemenawī šine t’ibebi, ādhunika kalā, arte moderna_

Though modern art theoretically encompasses all of the other categories, we’d like to focus on truly experimental works. For example, I saw one a few years ago where someone had arranged broken glass deliberately on a cement floor in the Dia Museum. Another favorite was a gallery that a photographer had set up in New York City that included what looked like four large smears with a much smaller photograph pinned beneath–in reality the smears were the same as the photographs, but the artist had taken a one pixel wide column and stretched it until it was a square.

Are there any experimental movements your speakers are involved in? Has someone slashed a blank canvas and declared it “anti-art”? Have they started exploring stimulating other senses while people view their work like playing noises in their galleries or filling them with perfumes? Tell us what sort of weird stuff your folks get into!

**Additional words:** minimalism, medium, movement, subversive, transgressive, avant-garde
