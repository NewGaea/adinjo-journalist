Hey hi hello! For some reason, when we laid out the schedule for topics, Allen wanted today to be about **RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY**. Today we’re going to talk about some of the beliefs and traditions of your speakers, while some of you are celebrating some of your own.

Today’s spotlight concepts are:

### TRADITION

_ənənə, kanohelvhi, butamaduni, paweni, cosaan, adat_

Tradition is something you do because someone before you did it. They probably did it because someone before them did it too. What kinds of traditions do your speakers have? Is there a division between secular traditions and religious traditions? How is tradition maintained?

Related Words: traditional, ancient, to pass on, oral history, to celebrate, to repeat, habits, customs.

### RITUAL

_ritenga, defod, sunilaw, pitii, tuqus, gisek_

Rituals, understood pretty broadly as sequences of words or actions done at certain times in certain contexts with specific meaning, are a human cultural universal. A ritual can be as complicated as a complete religious rite or weeks-long pilgrimage, or it can be as simple as a codified greeting. What sorts of ritual actions, words, spaces, and practices do your speakers have? Bonus: write us a blessing or incantation in your conlang!

Related Words: practice, ritual (adj), to perform a ritual, to ritualize, to recite, to repeat, ingrained, sacred.

### GOD

_tekocin, kotaa, oitu, dieu, allah, nnongo_

A God is a sacred supernatural being, usually seen as having some kind of power over some part of the world. Some cultures say there’s just one of them, a supreme creator who rules over the world. Others say there are many, and might pick different ones to worship in different scenarios. Others might say there are many but only care about one, and yet others might say the gods are to be avoided entirely! Many cultures also tell stories about their gods. What stories do your speakers tell?

Related Words: deity, goddess, holy, pantheon, to apotheose, apotheosis, to create, to be powerful, to be ancient.

### SPIRIT

_aneneq, sinigix, asisi, espri, limo, oorisimun_

The word spirit has a couple overlapping meanings in English. One is the sense of an animating force within living things, akin to a person’s soul. Another sense is that of a dead person’s soul sticking around and inhabiting the world. A third sense is a supernatural being associated with a particular item or natural feature, like a forest spirit or river spirit. It would be pretty reasonable to lexicalize all of these separately, and to make even more kinds of distinctions. What kinds of spirits (in all of these senses or others) does your conlang have words for?

Related Words: soul, saint, tutelary spirit, ghost, to haunt, to materialize, to summon, spirited, to smell (like teen spirit).

### GOODNESS

_latcha, khaya, bonté, atsoga, changala, laoi_

Many people see religion and spirituality as a way to connect with a community, but also as a way to move towards goodness. What goodness really entails is incredibly culturally variable. Give me ten people and I’ll give you ten different ways of defining it. Let’s hear a little bit about what’s considered good and what’s considered evil for the different religious and spiritual practices in your world.

Related Words: good, better, best, to improve, evil, to get worse, bad, to be good, to be bad (of allen’s opinions), enlightenment, good deed.
