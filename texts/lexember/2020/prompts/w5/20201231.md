Today is the final day of Lexember 2020 and indeed the final day of 2020. As we celebrate the dawn of a new year (or rather the end of this year), today’s prompt is going to be a little different. We won’t include spotlight concepts or photo/natlang word prompts like all the previous days have. Why? Because, today, we’re talking about **NAMES**.

So yeah, we’re gonna do a little freestyle to wrap things up.

Today, consider the names of:

+ People
+ Pets/Companion Animals
+ Cities, Neighborhoods, and Streets
+ Rivers, lakes, and oceans
+ Mountains, Valleys, and other Geological formations
+ People Groups
+ Languages
+ Heavenly Bodies
+ Gods and Spirits

How are the names for these things determined? Names are often used to describe the thing being named, to honor something, or represent different values and interests associated with the thing being named. Who is responsible for naming people/things? Can names be changed? Are names extremely significant or not (if so, how?)? If a person dies, does it become taboo to say their name until a certain time? Are personal names handed down through generations? Are there personal names and family names? Second or third names? Honorific names and diminutive names?

Names can derive from abstract concepts, values, animals, people, legends, myths, resources, objects, natural wonders… just about anything. Some cultures are rather strict about what can and cannot be names, while others aren’t. Have fun with it, and name some stuff!

**Related Words:** to name, to rename, to call, to label, to refer, to identify, to introduce, to be, to call on/for, title, family name, endonym, exonym, nick name, honorific title, tag, badge.
