Hey everyone! Today’s topic is **TECHNOLOGY**. People tend to make conlangs in fictional worlds, with all different sorts of technological backgrounds. Some peoples’ conlangs are spoken by a single stone-age village, while others are lingua francas of entire galactic empires. So today’s prompt is a compromise: I’m going to give five different pieces of technology from five different time points. Write about whichever ones are most relevant for your conculture.

Today’s spotlight concepts are:

### WHEEL

_aksraligaun, qalla, rodha, möör, nzinga, təkər_

This invention really got things rolling. Turns out that putting heavy things on round things lets them move easily! This invention was apparently made several times in history, for pottery, transportation, and children’s toys! What do your speakers call the different parts of a wheel? What sorts of wheeled contraptions do they use?

**Related Words:** rrrrround, to spin, cycle, chakra, hub, spoke, axel, tire, to roll, to drive, car, cart, wagon, train, ball bearing.

### TO PRINT

_perehi, chap kardan, tisknout, taba’a, ch'ipachina, galeyadv_

The invention of moveable type and later the printing press allowed information to spread in an unprecedented way. There’s a straight line of innovation from Tang Dynasty woodblocks to the word processor I’m using to draft this prompt. Even in a digital era, paper is still relevant! Technology adapts but even old things stick around. What use do your conlang’s speakers have for printing? What do they print and why? What methods do they use?

**Related Words:** woodblock, printing, press, type, font, to type, inkjet, laser, HP LASERJET P4014 IS NOT CONNECTED, printer, pressman, ink, to roll, paper, imprint, to publish.

### ELECTRICITY

_tendyry, struum, laatriki miŋ, tiengkhi, listrik, ikumautit_

Dzzzt. Now we’re in the electric age. How did your speakers discover electricity? Does that influence what they call it? Our word comes from a word for “amber,” since amber can leave a static charge on things, but other languages made words based on lightning, current, fire, or sparkles. What do your speakers use it for? Is it a curiosity that makes frogs twitch or the underlying currency of society? Where do they get their electricity from?

**Related Words:** spark, current, resistance, voltage, wire, electron, charge, positive, negative, light, battery, capacitor, transistor, electrical, static electricity, lightning, impulse, energy, power.

### COMPUTER

_chīuhpōhualhuaztli, antañiqiq, tölva, dihnlóuh, makuɛ̈n, tingnaw_

And using electricity, we power computers! A lot of languages use a word derived from “count, reckon, do math” (or loan a word like that from another) but a couple have their own neologisms. Two of my favorites, both included in the examples, are “number witch” and “electric brain.” What do your speakers do on their computers? How integrated are computers into society? Have you Translated minecraft into your conlang yet?

**Related Words:** to compute, to calculate, calculator, monitor, to program, computer program, software, hardware, glitch, bug.

### SPACESHIP

_dayax gacmeed, wahana akariksa, keştiya fezayê, taaihūngsyùhn, espazio onti, vòl spasyal_

Ground control, we’ve made it to the future, over. We’ve been sailing between islands for thousands of years. Now it’s time to sail between the stars. If your speakers stick around on their planet, then what do they imagine is beyond it? If they leave, then what do they use to get off the planet? Do they make it to other star systems? What do they find there?

**Related Words:** orbit, capsule, rocket, thruster, engine, satellite, apogee, perigee, space suit, spacewalk, to lift off, to crash, to orbit, to fly.
