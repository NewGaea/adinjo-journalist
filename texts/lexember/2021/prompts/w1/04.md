# EXOCENTRIC COMPOUNDS

Hey nerds. Welcome back to Lexember, for another day of compounding. Yesterday focused on endocentric compounds, where the compound as a whole describes something that’s a type of the thing described by one of the components. Today we’re focusing on **exocentric compounds** which are...not that. An exocentric compound is one where the compound as a whole describes something that is not a type of thing represented by one of the components. There are a few different forms this can take.

Some exocentric compounds refer to something characterized by the elements of the compound. A ‘redhead’ isn’t a type of head and a ‘yellowfin’ isn’t a type of fin. They’re people with characteristically red heads or fish with characteristically yellow fins.

Many languages use coordinate compounds, which represent categories or qualities by compounding members of the category or values of the quality. Things like referring to furniture as _’table chair’_ or calling size _’big small.’_

A historical example I like is the _difrasismos_ of Classical Mesoamerican languages, which use compounds metaphorically to refer to something associated with the components. You might use **in ixtli in yollotl** _’the face the heart’_ to refer to a person or **in mitl in chimalli** _’the arrow the shield’_ to refer to war.

You can also have compounds of different parts of speech. Spanish uses verb+noun compounds to derive words for tools like **abrebotellas** _’bottle opener’ lit. ‘opens-bottles’_ or agent nouns more generally like **rompecabezas** _’puzzle’ lit. ‘breaks-heads.’_ Rather than using the basic forms of these stems, all of these compounds are formed using the third-person present indicative of the verb plus the plural form of the noun.

For day four we have more from Formor! Here is an example from u/f0rm0r’s language Māryanyā.

_ankapušcas_ \[aŋkaˈpuɕt͡ɕas\] 'scorpion'

This exocentric compound is what's called a bahuvrihi compound. Basically, it's a compound meaning "one who has a Y that is X". It is composed of the elements _anka_ meaning "crooked" and _pušca_ meaning "tail". Together, they mean "one that has a crooked tail", that is, a scorpion. Note that the difference between the syntax of this construction, a compound, and regular adjectival attribution: _pušcas ankas_, meaning a literal curved tail, has case marking on both words and they are in a different order.

What types of exogenous compounds does your conlang use? Are there certain forms that are used in the compounds? Do you have coordination compounds or _difrasismos_? Are there any exogenous compounds used in poetic registers, or maybe as euphemisms or avoidance speech?

Now I’ll hand you back over to Page for tomorrow’s discussion of **markedness**.
