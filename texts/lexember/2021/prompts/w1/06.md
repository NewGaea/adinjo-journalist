# SYNONYMY

Mia here again (or maybe I never truly left…) Happy to welcome you to Nym Week! Every day this week we’ll talk about a different figure of speech whose name contains ‘-nym.’

For day 1 of Nym Week, we’re talking about the familiar **synonym**. Two words are synonyms if they share a meaning. ‘Doglike’ and ‘canine,’ for example, both mean ‘similar to a dog,’ so they’re synonyms. You could say foxes have ‘doglike behavior’ or ‘canine behavior’ and mean the same thing.

But words are rarely (if ever!) perfect synonyms. On day 2 we talked about how those words have different connotations, with ‘canine’ being more formal. Synonyms often differ in register or connotation with each other.

Some words are only synonyms in certain contexts. The word ‘hard’ prototypically refers to something that isn’t soft, but it can also refer to something that isn’t easy. You would say that ‘difficult’ is a synonym for the second sense, but not the first.

Words with similar meanings may also collocate differently. Long, lengthy, and extended could all refer to something with more length than usual, but when was the last time a spam caller asked about your car’s ‘long warranty’? Even though the words can be synonyms, ‘extended warranty’ is a fixed phrase where you can’t swap out synonyms (‘lengthy guarantee’?) and mean the same thing.

A common source of synonyms is borrowing. Sometimes a borrowed word and a native word can coexist in the lexicon with similar senses. Turkish has the native words kara, ak, gök and kızıl for ‘black,’ ‘white,’ ‘blue’ and ‘red,’ but it also has common words with the same meanings, siyah, beyaz, mavi and kırmızı, which are derived from Persian and Arabic. Sometimes you can even get three co-existing words! Japanese has native ōkisa, Sino-Japanese ōsa, and English loan saizu, all of which can mean ‘size.’ We get this in English too, with native, French, and Latinate triplets like ’kingly,’ ’royal,’ and ’regal.’

Show us some synonyms in your language! Do they have different connotations? Are they used in different contexts or registers? What sources are there for words with similar or overlapping meanings? Any history of borrowing?

See you tomorrow for Opposite Day ;)
