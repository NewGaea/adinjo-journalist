# POLYSEMY

For the first day of Lexember, we'll be tackling a very important concept in lexical semantics (that is the study of what words mean, broadly speaking). That topic is **polysemy** \[pɑˈlɪsəmi\].

The word is from Greek, combining the word for "sign" with the prefix "poly-," meaning "many." This term refers to a single word or phrase's capacity to have multiple different meanings. For example, the word "to make" can either mean "to prepare" (he _made_ me a meal) or "to force" (she _made_ me do it) or "to appoint" (they _made_ me a subreddit moderator and i don't know why bc i cant even ask my waiter for barbecue sauce). Anyway, for all intents and purposes, "made" is the same word in all three sentences, but it has different meanings based on its context.

In natural languages, some level of polysemy is expected in most of its words, especially the most common verbs and nouns, which tend to have greater semantic variation in general. Sometimes, the polysemy is minor and straight-foward like "head." Whether you're talking about the head of a person, the head of a nail, or the head of a company, you're usually talking about whatever entity is at the top of something, typically with some level of control over the other parts.

Other examples of polysemy are more complex, far-reaching, and harder to synthesize, such as "to run." Consider:

1. They **ran** in a marathon.
2. She **ran** for Congress.
3. The newspaper **ran** the story.
4. The refrigerator stopped **running**.
5. My nose is still **running** from the cold.
6. The Danube River **runs** into the Black Sea.
7. He **runs** his father's restaurant.
8. The bus **runs** by here each morning.
9. The semester **runs** for four months.

The verb "run," prototypically refers to the action a person does with their legs, but its meaning has been broadened to a lot of different contexts where there's fast or constant motion. That is the key to polysemy: different meanings, but all somewhat related.

This is different from homophony (which we'll talk about later). Consider "steak" and "stake," which are two completely separate words with separate etymologies and separate meanings with no relation to each other. The fact they're pronounced the same is coincidental, so this is not an example of polysemy.

In conlanging, it's easy to be tempted to say that a single word has a single definition. However, natural languages will have a wealth of words that have varying degrees of polysemy. Some conlangs, of course, are not looking at "naturalism" as a goal. Perhaps you want to create a precise language with as little ambiguity as possible. Although that is certainly a fine and achievable goal, the fact is that polysemy helps us humans conserve brain space. Imagine if, in the list for meanings of "run," we needed a separate word for each of those contexts. They can _run_ a marathon, but she would _yarp_ for Congress and the Danube would _eagen_ into the Black Sea. That's a lot of unique words to memorize! So, polysemy is certainly helpful and efficient, at the small price of precision.

Here's an example of polysemy from the conlang **Golden Age Aeranir** by as_Avridán:

_**cȳlun**_ ( `GEN` _cȳlī_) [ˈkŷːɫʊ̃ˑ] eternal gender class iii noun

1. (of a blade) edge, point, tip
2. the effective part of something, the dangerous part of something
3. parapet, buttress
4. arc, arch, archway
5. bow (and arrow)
6. head (of the penis)
7. (collocation) cȳlun sullī: rainbow; lit. 'edge of the sky'
8. (collocation) cȳlum pānī: lightning, thunder; lit. 'edge of the storm'

From Old Aeranir _CIVLOM_, from Proto-Iscaric \*keiflom, from Proto-Maro-Ephenian \*kéydʰ-(dʰ)lo-m, from root \*keydʰ- 'to cut, to slice.'

Alright, now it's your turn. Share your new word(s) for today, the first day of Lexember! If there's an interesting case of polysemy, be sure to share it, and if not, consider doing something with it. (And if not, that's fine too. These prompts are just here to help out if you want it.)

Of course, there are many different kinds of polysemy, some of which we'll be covering on different days. Tomorrow, we'll be talking about the concept of a word's **connotative meaning**. See you there!
