# CONNOTATIVE MEANING

Fun fact: words actually have two different types of meanings: a denotative meaning and a connotative meaning. Denotative meanings refer to the content of a word’s definition, like how the definition of “dog” includes:

+ Carnivorous
+ Mammal
+ Long snout
+ Acute sense of smell
+ Non-retractable claws
+ Barks

These elements all contribute to the denotative meaning of “dog.” But, let’s look at another word, “canine.” Its denotative meaning is almost identical to “dog,” but most people tend to use these words in different contexts for different reasons. Thus, enters in the idea of **connotation**.

All words have a connotative meaning, and there are many types. A lot of words have a neutral connotation, so they’re used in any context (for example pronouns, determiners, or grammatical words). But, many other words do not. In the case of “dog” and “canine,” the connotative meanings differ in formality. “Dog” is the casual and common word while “canine” is the more scientific and formal term. Another example is “father,” “dad,” and “daddy” which also have the same denotative meaning, but radically different connotations based largely on intimacy. Connotative meanings can also be positive or negative like in the cases of “to protest,” vs. “to complain,” vs. “to whine.”

Let’s look at a fun example of denotative meaning from **Tsuy**, a conlang by Astianthus:

Tsuy has two nouns which can loosely be translated as 'heat/warmth' (often used attributively to describe something as being warm or hot). They differ in the precise kind of heat described, but they also differ in connotation. Here are two simple definitions of the words:

**yazú** [jɐ̄ʁó] _noun_

1. heat felt through the air, whether by convection or radiation, usually assumed to be unpleasant
2. (indirectly) irritability, anger, rudeness

(dạayki) [dàːjkɪ̄] _noun_

1. heat felt through direct touch, usually assumed to be pleasant
2. (indirectly) level-headedness, calmness, intimacy

As the definitions suggest, _yazú_ has negative connotations both as the actual sensation of heat, but also in the way it can be extended to indirectly describe emotional states. Much like how someone can be described as hot-headed in English, someone may be described as having a liver with _yazú_ in Tsuy if they are easily angried. On the other hand, _dạayki_ has positive connotations, being associated with rational decision-making and intimacy. There doesn't always have to be a very clear reason for connotations, but in this case it could at least partially be attributed to Tsuy speakers living in a hot climate where the sun's heat is mostly something to be avoided. To complete the temperature scale, Tsuy also has a word for 'cold' (but only one):

**bie** [bīː] _noun_

1. cold or cool temperatures
2. (indirectly) kindness, hospitality, happiness

In direct contrast to English cold, the Tsuy low-temperature word has solely positive connotations, likely stemming from the fact that shaded areas and cool homes are highly valued places to eat, rest, and so on.

So, tell me about different connotative meanings in your conlang! Perhaps you can find a word already existing in your conlang and then create a new word with the same denotative meaning, but a different connotative meaning. Or you can make a whole new set of words.

Tomorrow, I’m gonna sleep in hand it over to u/roipoiboy for the next couple of days to talk about compounding.
