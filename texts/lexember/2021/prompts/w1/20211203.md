ENDOCENTRIC COMPOUNDS

You can’t always learn what things mean from their etymology, but it’s always worth a try. So let’s break it down now, y’all: **compound** is from Latin **cum-** _’with, together’_ and **ponō** _’to put,’_ so it must involve putting things together. **Endo-** is from a Greek word for _’inner’_ (incidentally a direct cognate for English ’into’) and **centric** is from, you guessed it, the Greek word for _’center.’_ Put it all back together and you get a figure of speech made by putting together multiple components, where its ‘center’ is on the inside. So what does that mean?

A **compound** is an expression that consists of more than one stem put together to express something. An **endocentric compound** is a type of compound where the whole expression refers to something that’s a type of thing described by one of the components. The noun that refers to the category that the compound belongs to is called the ‘head noun.’ English has a lot of these: a sheepdog is a type of dog, a doghouse is a type of house, a houseplant is a type of plant, plant food is a type of food, etc.

Usually if a language’s adjectives come before the noun, then the last component in a compound is the head, like in the English examples above. On the other hand, if adjectives tend to come after the noun, then the head is usually the first noun. In Arabic, nouns come before modifying adjectives, and similarly head nouns come before modifying nouns in compounds. So you get **ṭabību ’asnānin** `doctor teeth` _’dentist’ lit. ‘tooth doctor.’_

Sometimes there are special forms of words used in compounds. The word _’pants’_ is a plurale tantum in English, meaning it only occurs in the plural. You can’t have just one pant. But English doesn’t usually allow plurals as modifiers in compounds, so even with a plurale tantum you can get compounds like _‘pant leg.’_

You usually think of compounds in terms of nouns, but they can be any part of speech. In English, you often get compound adjectives with colors like _’yellow-orange’_ or _’blue-green.’_ Some languages (like my conlang hehe) allow you to compound verbs, such as Chinese **dàilái** _’bring’_ lit. _‘carry come.’_ English has a couple of these, with words like _’stir-fry’_ or _’blow-dry.’_

Here are some examples of endocentric compounds from my com-page-triot, the one and only Page (that is, u/upallday_allen):

In Wistanian, nominal compounding is extremely productive. Most compounds consist of a head noun followed by an attributive noun. Theoretically, any nominal in the language can be either a head noun or an attributive noun in a compound, and most compounds are endocentric.

Since this is productive, compounding doesn’t alway give rise to brand new lexical items, but sometimes they do. For example, the native word for Wistanian is **aningali** \[ən̻iːŋɡəli\], a compound of **ani-n** (‘word-PL’ or ‘language’) and **gali** (‘to make calm’ or ‘peace’), translating roughly to “the language of peace,” but specifically referring to Wistanian and not just any calming or soothing statements. Some other examples:

+ **lari maud** \[l̻aːɾ̻i mɑːd̻\] // (from brush+hair) hair brush
+ **guhi gai** \[ᵑɡɯːɦi̤ ᵑɡa͡i\] // (from joint+forearm) elbow
+ **hani aram** \[ɣa̤ːn̻i aːɾ̻əm\] // (from place+bowl) cupboard
Although these endocentric compounds are easily interpretable by its parts, it would be very unnatural for a Wistanian speaker to refer to the wrist as a guhi gai, even though that is a joint in the forearm; and it would be strange to call a cupboard a hani zu (place+cup). Therefore, I would say that these endocentric compounds have essentially become their own lexical item.

Come up with a few endocentric compounds in your language! Is your language generally head-initial or head-final? What sorts of relationships can there be between the parts of a compound? What parts of speech allow compounding? If you have productive verb compounding, then I wanna see it!
