# MARKEDNESS

(Posted on behalf of u/upallday_allen whose library was closed today for a Christmas parade and couldn’t get internet.)

**Markedness** in lexical semantics is a similar concept to **connotative meaning** in that it’s something extra added on to a word’s denotative meaning. But, rather than having emotional or pragmatic differences, markedness largely refers to the cultural assumptions we apply to different words. The best way to demonstrate this is with examples.

Consider the word “nurse.” The denotative definition is “a person who is trained to care for sick or injured people and who usually works in a hospital or doctor's office” (Merriam-Webster). However, for many people, this word carries an assumption about the person’s gender in that if the nurse is a man, the term would be _marked_ as “male nurse.”

In this case, “nurse” is _unmarked_ for female gender, which means that even though “female” is not part of the denotative meaning, it’s still assumed in such a way that some people feel compelled to add a “mark” if a nurse is not a female.

Another example is the term “marriage” which is unmarked for heterosexuality in such a way that if the marriage were between men or between women, it would need to be marked as a “gay marriage.”

A good way of thinking about markedness is as a “cultural default.” For a long time nurses were by default women and marriages were by default heterosexual (and even today, that is the overwhelming tendency), so when a nurse or a marriage breaks that default, people will want to mark it, usually with a modifier.

So a good definition of markedness is that _unmarked_ terms refer to some assumed default, while marked terms are modified to indicate non-defaults.

In English, and many other languages, most cases of markedness are related to gender and sexuality, but not always. Outside the United States, “football” is understood by default to refer to the sport played with the spherical black and white ball, and then _marked_ as “American football” when referring to the sport with the brown egg-shaped ball. A “road” is by default paved, but when it isn’t, speakers are compelled to mark it as an “unpaved road” or “back road” or a “dirt/gravel/yellow brick road.” A common housecat is by default domesticated, but if not, it’s marked as a “feral cat.”

Uh oh! We don’t have an example from a conlang for you today. I will refrain from publicly shaming the head moderator of this very subreddit who promised to provide us with one today, but I will take the opportunity to say that YOU can help this from happening again.

We still have a few days that we need examples for. If you’ve seen the conlang examples from past posts and would like to contribute your own, message either me or u/roipoiboy on here or on Discord, and we’ll get you all set up!

So, do you have any examples of markedness in your lexicon? Share it with us! This is a great way to think about the culture surrounding your conlang (if you have one, of course) and how their assumptions and defaults can influence their language use.

Thanks to u/roipoiboy for posting this while my ~free internet~ library was closed. You’ll see him again tomorrow to kick off what we’re calling “Nym Week” with a discussion on synonyms!
