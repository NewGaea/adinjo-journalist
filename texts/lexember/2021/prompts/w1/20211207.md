# ANTONYMS

A synonym of synonym is ‘poecilonym’ (apparently), and an antonym of synonym is ‘antonym’! **Antonyms** are pairs of words that mean the opposite of each other. Common examples of opposites you might remember from kindergarten are big and small, dead and alive, or cats and dogs. But do all of these have the same relation to each other?

Some pairs of antonyms are opposite ends of gradable scales. Size is continuous, and we have terms that refer to things that are higher or lower on that scale than other things. Big things are at one end of the scale and small things at the other, so these are gradable antonyms. Other examples are hot and cold or dark and light.

How about dead and alive? In their most literal sense, you can’t be more or less dead than anything else. It’s a binary. You’re either dead or you’re not. Complementary antonyms like these divide all relevant things into two discrete groups, which are opposite from each other. Other complementary antonyms include occupied and vacant or on and off.

Now the last set, cats and dogs. If you ask a kid what the opposite of a cat is, chances are that yep, they’ll say a dog. But at the end of the day are they all that different? They’re both domesticated carnivores. Lizards, buttons, or ice cubes are certainly more different from cats than dogs are, but dogs and cats are thought of as opposing members of a set. These are sometimes called disjoint opposites, and ~Wikipedia also lists~ you might find examples such as red and blue or Monday and Friday.

Since we’re still missing community submissions for a few days *cough cough* I have a few examples of antonyms in my own conlang Mwaneḷe for ya.

Just like how words with different senses can have different synonyms for each sense, a single word can have different antonyms for each sense. **Owowu** means ‘long’ for fibers, poles, and other high-aspect-ratio sorts of things, but it also means ‘tall’ for people. Its antonym **kolo** means ‘short,’ but can also mean ‘high-pitched’ or ‘shallow’ when talking about water.

For the sense of ‘short,’ I’d say that the antonym of **kolo** is **owowu**, but for the other two senses, I’d say it’s **xas**, which can mean ‘low-pitched’ or ‘deep’ (of water).

Thing is, **xas** can also mean ‘high up’ or ‘tall’ when talking about mountains. Its antonym for those senses is **‘mikwa,’** which means ‘low-lying, small’ for geographical features, but also ‘short-lasting’ and ‘simple, unadorned.’

If something lasts a long time, then it’s **legabwak** and if something is complicated then it’s **ṣaṣo**, which also means ‘dense, thick,’ whose opposite is **peṣo** ‘sparse, thin,’ which can also mean ‘new’ and so on and so on and so on!

Let’s hear about antonyms. Bonus points if you can come up with an antonym pair in each of the categories I mentioned!

Tomorrow we’ll continue nym week with **contronyms**.
