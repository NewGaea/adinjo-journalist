# CONTRONYMS

Yesterday we talked about pairs of words whose meanings are opposites. What about single words which have opposing meanings?

A **contronym** also known as an **auto-antonym** is a word which can serve as its own opposite. A classic English example is ‘to cleave,’ which can mean ‘stick together’ (they cleave to their old ways) or ‘break apart’ (he cleaved the pork shoulder in two).

Contronyms generally form in three different ways: first you can have words that are etymologically distinct, but end up merging. That’s what happened when a word meaning ‘separate’ and a word meaning ‘stick’ merged to give us cleave.

You can also have words where one root undergoes semantic drift in two different ways. The word ‘sanction’ comes from a Latin root for law or decree. In a positive sense, a ‘sanction’ can refer to an official approval of something (the IOC sanctions the use of gatorade but not of steroids), while in a negative sense it can refer to an official punishment for something (the US government tightened sanctions on Iran). Both senses come from the same root, but moved in different directions to become antonyms.

Last, you can have words that have a single, broader meaning that can refer to subparts of that broader meaning that seem like opposites. In some dialects of French, _’prêter’_ can mean both ‘lend’ and ‘borrow,’ and more commonly _’apprendre’_ can mean both ‘learn’ and ‘teach.’ These have the overarching senses of ‘temporarily transfer objects’ and ‘exchange information,’ but in their more narrow senses they can refer to opposing perspectives of the same event, so they can act like opposites!

Here are some examples from u/ursa_subpar’s conlang Rihogi.

**otso** \[ɔ.͡tsɔ\] verb 1. to bloom; to grow 2. to lose or shed leaves, generally in the winter

When nouns are verbified in Rihogi, they can often take both the meaning of “gaining [noun]” and “losing [noun]”. So the verb form of the noun “leaf/flower” can mean both “to grow leaves” and “to lose leaves,” with meaning generally being obvious from context and season.

**otikomo** \[ɔ.t̪iˈqɔ.mɔ\] adjective 1. tied up; secured 2. knotted; tangled; destroyed

In sailing terms, a knot that can’t easily be undone is a good thing. On a ship, something that is described as otikomo is well secured and working perfectly. But in other areas the word takes on a connotation of something that is beyond repair. Otikomo can describe something as small as cloth that is knotted or shredded, up to a building or town that has been burned to the ground, with nothing usable remaining.

**gamnan** \[gɐm.n̪ɐn̪\] adverb 1. efficiently 2. haphazardly

From an old word meaning “without thought.” Archaically, gamnan meant to be able to perform a task quickly, automatically and without thinking. The usage shifted over time to mean doing something as fast as possible with minimum thought and effort.

**karra** \[kɐ.rɐ\] verb 1. to farm; to grow food 2. to forage

The words for farming and foraging were originally completely different, with separate roots and etymologies, but sound changes eroded them enough to become homophones. Due to the relatively similar meanings of growing or finding food, the word has come to be used interchangeably.

**hatsenmo** \[ɸæ.͡tsɛn̪.mɔ\] verb 1. to send 2. to receive; to be given, generally indirectly

With Rihogi’s robust case system, some verbs can take dual meanings while still remaining clear within a sentence. Hatsenmo indicates that something is being sent and/or received, with the declensions of the related nouns indicating the specific relationship.

What words do you have that are their own opposites? Any fun etymologies or semantic drift there?

We’ll make a lot mero words tomorrow when we talk about… **meronymy**!
