# HYPONYMY

Who’s hyped for today’s prompt? Today we’re talking about **hyponyms**, words that refer to a subcategory of a particular thing. _’Hypo-’_ is from Greek for ‘below,’ so it might help to think of hyponyms as being the different words below a larger category on some sort of organizational tree.

Say you have a word for a category like ‘bird.’ Hyponyms of bird would be different kinds, like gulls, passerines, raptors, penguins, and so on. Then hyponyms of raptor might be eagle, hawk, falcon etc.

If two words are hyponyms of the same other word, they’re said to be **co-hyponyms** or **allonyms**. So gull is an allonym of raptor and falcon is an allonym of hawk.

Sometimes words can act as their own hyponyms! For example, the verb ‘to drink’ means ‘to orally ingest liquids’ broadly, but without really specifying what liquids. It can also be used specifically to refer to drinking alcohol. Since alcohol-drinking is a subset of all drinking, the second sense of ‘drink’ is a hyponym of the first sense. That way, one meaning of a word can be a hyponym of another.

Newclogn by MatzahDog

Newclogn has a multitude of words referring to eating:

_Fú cuúr_ /ɸú cǔːɬ/ - to eat fruits This hyponym is used whenever you're eating something that grows on trees, such as fruits and nuts. It's also used with things that taste fruity or sweet, such as sugary snacks. It's derived from _fú_ "to be fruity" and _cuúr_ "edible plant".

_Ookë ngak_ /oːkɛ ŋak/ - to eat insects This hyponym is used whenever you're eating small insects, bugs, or any dish containing them (Newclogn speakers often fry bugs to season food). In recent generations, it's also been used for seafood. It's derived from _ookë_ "to be gross" and _ngok_ "edible land animal".

_Mar ga_ /maɬ ga/ - to eat dinner This hyponym is used whenever eating dinner or any other evening meal. It's almost exclusively used to describe large meals, often shared with family. It's derived from _mar_ "to burn" and _go_ "time", although it has since undergone semantic shift, as it used to mean "to cook".

Do you have any words whose meanings changed from representing a particular type of something to the thing as a whole? What sorts of categories do your speakers divide things into? Any important distinctions they make between different hyponyms that aren’t present in your native language?

Tomorrow stay hyped for us to talk about **hypernyms**.
