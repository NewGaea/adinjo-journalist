# MERONYMY

A **meronym** is a word that refers to a part of something else. If you use the phrase ‘tiny glowing screens’ to refer to phones, that’s an instance of meronymy. The opposite of a meronym is a **holonym**, a word that refers to the whole that something else is part of. (Think back a couple days...what kind of antonyms are these then?)

Referring to something by a meronym is called _pars pro toto_ (Latin for ‘a part for the whole’), while referring to something by a holonym can be called _totum pro parte_ (no points for guessing what this one means, although to be honest I had only ever heard _pars pro toto_ before researching this prompt). _Pars pro toto_ and _totum pro parte_ together are referred to as **synecdoche** /sɪˈnɛkdəki/ ~not to be confused with the city up the river from me.~

One common form of meronymy is to refer to something by its useful part. You might call your car your ‘wheels’ or refer to your computer as a ‘CPU.’

You might say you need ‘as many hands as you can get,’ when you’re really referring to people who are using their hands. If you’re looking for something you might say ‘as many eyes’ and if you’re listening ‘as many ears,’ but really you don’t need disembodied parts--you need people attached to them. But you can refer to the people by their important parts.

Today’s focus was on meronymy, but if holonymy is more your speed, then go for it. What sorts of synecdoche do your speakers use? Are there any well-known rhetorical examples? Any words whose meanings shifted over time from part to whole or from whole to part?

See you tomorrow as nym week continues. We’ll \*ahem\* narrow in on **hyponymy**.
