# HYPERNYMY

The reverse of hyponymy is **hypernymy**. A hypernym is a broader category to which something else belongs. For example, ‘bird’ is a hypernym of gull, passerine, and raptor. Some words can even be hypernyms for themselves! The verb ‘drink’ can mean ‘to consume alcohol’ but its more general sense means ‘to consume liquids,’ which means the broader sense is a hypernym for the narrower sense. These examples sound familiar… You know what? Maybe hypernymy and hyponymy should have been a single day…

In addition to all of what we talked about yesterday, here’s some food for thought: since languages divide semantic space differently, you may get a word in one language translated as its hypernym in another language.

A good example for this is kinship terms. In languages like Cantonese, [family terms can get pretty complicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1HaZ4WLo50). Sticking with a simple example, there are distinct words for older sister, je2je2, and younger sister, mui6mui6. There are also various ways to address your own sisters, for example you might call your older sister ga1je1 and your younger sister a1mui2. It’s less common to say someone’s just your ‘sister’ than it is to specify their relative age.

These distinctions aren’t really reflected in English! If you translated them, you’d have to use a hypernym like ‘sister’ (which loses some information). In English, we don’t really think of ‘sister’ as a hypernym, since there aren’t any readily apparent hyponyms, but when translating from another language it might be!

In Yajéé (by u/ratsawn), **wa** ‘bird’ is a hypernym of more specific types of birds, such as **wagwómo** ‘moa’ or **chiije** ‘parrot’. However, chiije is also a hypernym of more specific types of parrots, including the culturally significant **poras** parrot, as well as the large, hog-like **kwon**. Words like these also map to multiple hypernyms. For instance, wagwómo and kwon are both types of **yorö́heri** ‘creatures which resemble nonliving entities’, a hypernym they share with **loga umunaḍaa** ‘stone frog’ and the **iha**, a superficially cat or quoll-like camouflaged ambush hunter of parrots. All these terms could be grouped under the hypernym **nibi** ‘animal’, or even broader including plants and insects into **heri** ‘living thing’.

What examples of hypernyms do you have in your language? Are there any levels of hypernymy present in your conlang that you don’t have in your natlang? How about hypernyms that cover things that your language treats as distinct, when other languages might not? Any diachronically minded folks have words whose meanings have broadened over time?

See you tomorrow as we rap up Nym Week with **metonymy**.
