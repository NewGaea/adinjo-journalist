# BLENDING

Today’s topic is another common process of word-formation called **blending**, which is when you take two (or more) terms and smoosh them together. This is different from compounding because that’s when two words are kept totally intact and used together. It’s also (technically) different from a complex clipping. In a blend, you take segments from one word and add it to segments from another word. An example is “smog” from the words “smoke” and “fog.” The “sm” segments are taken from “smoke” and blended with the “og” segment from “fog.” These segments are called “splinters” because “sm” and “og” are meaningless on their own unless they are part of the blend.

This happens a lot with ship names like “Brangelina” from “Brad (Pitt)” and “Angelina (Jolie)” or “Kataang” from “Katara” and “Aang” (from _Avatar: The Last Airbender_).

Typically, in English, blends are formed by taking the first onset of one word and combining it with the rhyme of the next word (plus anything else outside of the first syllable.)

For example “brunch” is a blend formed with the first onset of “breakfast” and the rhyme of “lunch.” “Friend” and “enemy” are formed with the first onset of “friend,” “fr,” and, since there is no initial onset in “enemy” for “fr” to replace, it’s added onto the entire word as “frenemy.”

However, some blends break that mold like “Spanglish” (from “Spanish” + “English”) and “Eurasia” (“Europe” + “Asia”). In the case of “Spanglish” there is already a type of phonetic overlap in the /n/ and /ŋ/ segments, which prompts the splinters to intersect there, while “Europe” moved the splinter boundary to its first coda because “Yasia” doesn’t make much sense or really capture “Europe.” Sometimes, entire words are inserted into other words because of phonological similarities like how “dork” blends with “adorable” as “adorkable.”

For an example of blending in action, let’s look at impishdullahan’s conlang Tokétok:

In the very early days of Tokétok, many words were derived through blending. In fact, the majority of derivational prefixes are derived through reanalysis of commonly blended words. Unlike in English, however, which prefers to blend the beginning of one word with the end of another, Tokétok will just compound the initial segments of both words, clipping the ends of the words.

A good example of blending the initial segments of a word is **fampét**, 'roof', which derives from the words **famme**, 'building', and **pétte**, 'cover'.

As regards now common derivational prefixes, the adjectives **kahi'** and **rotte** are the most prototypical, the first syllables of which have been reanalysed as a diminutive and augmentative prefix, respectively.

+ **Kahi'**, 'small' + **mowwe**, 'to wound' → **kamow**, 'to spite'.
+ **Rotte**, 'large' + **motte**, 'forest' → **romot**, 'the world'.

There is one example that breaks this usual pattern of clipping the ends of words and combining them together, and that's in the evolution of the comitative case. The comitative prefix is **ké-** and it evolved from the preposition **wikke**. In this case, the initial syllable was dropped and the remaining vowel fortified. **Ké-** and **\*wikke** are still interchangeable so we can say historic phrasal terms contrast with modern comitative derivations:

+ **Wikke pétte**, 'with covering' vs. **képét**, 'covered'.
+ **Wikke caka**, 'with burning' vs. **kécak**, 'burnt'.
+ **Wikke aşak**, 'with passion' vs. **kéşak**, 'zealous'. (This one is especially strange in that only the end of both words survive into the blended form.)

What are some examples of blends in your conlangs? What are the rules or patterns for blends? Is “clong” a blend or just a disaster of a word that should never be analyzed linguistically lest we die? ~I know this from experience.~

I’m taking (another) break, and u/roipoiboy is gonna talk at y’all about **reduplication**.
