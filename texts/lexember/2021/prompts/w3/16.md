# REANALYSIS

**Reanalysis** is a process where speakers take words or morphemes that frequently appear together and break them down into different parts than the ones they were originally built with. This often involves **rebracketing**, where some old morpheme boundaries are lost and new ones are drawn.

In English, the indefinite article is ‘a’ before consonants and ‘an’ before vowels. There are a number of words that originally began with the letter n, but lost it after speakers reanalyzed it as being the last n of ‘an’ rather than the first n of, say, ‘napron’ or ‘norange,’ giving us modern English’s ‘apron’ and ‘orange.’ The reverse happened too! The n from ‘an’ in ‘an apkin’ and ‘an ewt’ moved on over to give us ‘a napkin’ and ‘a newt.’

There are some examples where this happened more than once to the same word! The French cognate of ‘unicorn’ is _licorne_, but it’s from the same root! The word started out as _‘unicorne’_ (with the silent e at the end, cause ya know, French). That got reanalyzed as _’une icorne’_ with the feminine indefinite article _’une.’_ The definite form of that would be _’l’icorne’_ with the definite article _’la’_ contracting with the vowel-initial word until…that got reanalyzed as part of the stem itself! So now the stem is _’licorne’_ with definite and indefinite forms _’la licorne’_ and _’une licorne.’_

Reanalysis is common with borrowed words, as speakers try and adapt them to native structures. English borrowed the word ‘helicopter’ from Greek, where the _‘helico’_ part means ‘spiral’ and the _‘pter’_ part means ‘wing’ (since they have wings that move around in a spiral shape). But \<pt-\> isn’t a legal onset in English, so speakers figured the word couldn’t possibly break down as helico-pter, and was probably something like heli-copter. So words derived from helicopter often use a prefix _heli-_ (helipad, heliport, heliskiing) or a suffix _-copter_ (quadcopter, hydrocopter).

Borrowed words can also be interpreted as having native derivational morphology and have morphological boundaries inserted where there weren’t any before. The Arabic loanword **kitabu** _’book’_ in Swahili was rebracketed as the singular prefix _’ki-’_ plus a root _’-tabu’_ and takes the native plural prefix to give a plural _’vitabu’_. Cantonese borrowed the English word ‘okay’ as _’ou1 kei1’_ and treats it like native verb+noun and verb+verb compounds in allowing you to form questions by copying the first part of the verb with the negative particle, to give things like _’lei5 ou1 m4 ou1 kei1 a1,’_ ‘are you okay?’ In analyzing ‘okay’ as a Cantonese word, they more or less inserted a morpheme boundary there!

**Aedian** by u/Cawlo

## neu-

Old Aedian had a verb, _nufiu_ (“to predict; to foresee; to expect”), which was continued through Middle Aedian _\*nuheu_ into Aedian _nueu-_ (“to imagine; to envision; to expect”).

Through reduplication, a verbal noun _\*nunufiu_ (“prediction”) came into use in Early Middle Aedian, later ending up as _nunheu_ (“imagination; consciousness”) and finally as _nuneu_ (“memory; consciousness”).

This noun was then reanalyzed as a verb with the noun-deriving prefix _nu-_, which was removed: The resulting verb was _neu-_, meaning “to remember; to think about”.

## iuši-

The Old Aedian verb _yoṛoa_ \[ˈjor̥oa̯\] (“to crush; to smash”) was continued through Middle Aedian _\*yošō_ and into Aedian _iušo-_, retaining more or less the same meaning. A passive participle-like adjective was derived herefrom using the suffix _-(i)ba_, giving rise to the Early Aedian adjective _\*iušoba-_ (“beaten; crushed”).

Almost all Aedian adjectives have an adverbial form, usually marked with some kind of ablaut. One common alternation is i or u in the adjectival form becoming o in the adverbial form. The _-o-_ of _\*iušoba-_ was reinterpreted as such an adverbial _-o-_, the adjectival form thought to be _iušiba-_, which is found in canonical Aedian, meaning (“tired; exhausted; bruised”).

The suffix _-(i)ba_, however, was still recognizable, and through backformation it was removed, thus giving birth to the new verb _iuši-_ (“to work hard; to train; to challenge oneself”).

## kammu

The Old Aedian adjective _muju_ (“sick”) was continued into Aedian _musu-_, retaining the old meaning. In Middle Aedian, the noun _\*mumusu_ (“condition; sickness”) was created through reduplication, resulting in Aedian _mumsu_ (“health; condition”).

During Middle Aedian, a further derivation from _\*mumusu_ was made, using the verb _\*ka-_ (“to die”) to form the noun _\*ka-mumusu_, resulting in the Early Aedian noun _\*kammus_ (“lethal disease; lethal condition”). The final _-s_ of _\*kammus_ was later reinterpreted as the nominative _-s_, giving us the canonical Aedian noun _kammu_.

## kidar

Back in Proto-Aedian, the suffix _-dea_ was used to form verbs from nouns, resulting in a class of verbs known as “_-dea_ verbs” (“_-de_ verbs” in Aedian grammar). One of these verbs was _\*dla-dea_ (“to create; to compose; to confect”), from the root _\*dla_ (“knot; bond; glue”), from Proto-Kotekko-Pakan _\*ʰtˡa_.

This verb, _\*dla-dea_, would've come out as _\*radea_ in Old Aedian, but in order to avoid resemblance with _rato_ (“to have sex”), it was further specified by incorporating the adjective _keda_ (“new”), resulting in the Old Aedian verb _kedaradea_, finally giving us Aedian _kidarde_ (“to make; to create”).

The suffix _-de_ was still recognized as a productive way to form verbs from nouns. The underlying noun, then, was assumed to be _kidar_ (which never existed in the first place) and was given the meaning “(final) product; meal”.

## ukpu-

The Old Aedian phrase _foki foka_ (“stone rod”) underwent univerbation in Early Middle Aedian as _\*fokifoka_, continued through _\*hokpoka_ and into Aedian as _ukpuka_ (“chisel”).

The final _-ka_ was reanalyzed as the agentive suffix _-ka_ (related to _kaga_ (“man”)), and by removing it the new verb _ukpu-_ (“to chisel; to carve using a chisel”).

This is one of my favorite processes, so I’m glad I got to do this day! What sorts of reanalysis has happened in your language? Any from loans? How about folk etymologies, where people have commonly acknowledged and believed analyses of words that don’t match their real origin?

Have you been getting all of those spam calls about debt restructuring lately? I sure have. If so, you can look forward to tomorrow, when we’re talking about **loans**!
