# FOSSILIZATION

We all know that words come in and out of a language’s lexicon all the time, but some words continue to stick around even after they have lost their relevance. Words that have fallen out of use but remain in some linguistic forms (such as idioms) are called **fossilizations**. Think of it like dead words that have been preserved in certain phrases (just like real fossils!).

In English, a good example of a fossilized word is “ado,” a word that once meant “business” or “thing(s) to do,” but now it only exists in certain set phrases like “Without further ado” and “much ado about nothing.” Another fun one is “nap” which is probably an old obsolete variant of “nab” which means “to steal or seize,” hence the word “kidnap.”

Probably my favorite example of a fossilized word is “nother” which only exists in the phrase “a whole nother (thing).” The word that we know as “another” used to be analyzed as “a nother,” then it was reanalyzed (see Day 16) to be a single word except for in that one phrase.

Today’s prompt is a short one, but fossilized words are a pretty straight-forward concept and there’s a lot of fun things you can do for it. What are some set phrases in your conlangs that use fossilized words? Give us a little con-linguistic history lesson.

Come _hither_, talk to us about the whole _shebang_ to your _kith_ and kin and _wreak_ havoc in the comments without any _ulterior_ motive but to expand your lexicons!
