# REDUPLICATION

Hello hello! Today we’re talking about **reduplication**, a process where languages create one form by repeating part of all of another. It’s common for reduplication to be somewhat iconic: a process that repeats a word often serves to indicate the meaning might be increased or repeated in some way. You might see reduplication used to mark plurality or derive words for groups of things, larger categories, repeated actions and so on.

It’s not terribly productive in English, but there are still plenty of examples. In English we form a lot of child-talk words with reduplication: boo-boo, night-night, pee-pee, bye-bye. We also have a lot of sound effect words that sometimes repeat entirely (choo-choo, tut-tut) or words that repeat while alternating front and back vowels (tick-tock, ding-dong, clip-clop, pitter-patter)

Indonesian can show some more uses of reduplication. In Indonesian, it’s common to derive adverbs from adjectives by reduplicating them, so **keras** _’hard, strong, loud’_ can give the adverb **keras-keras**. You can derive related words, like from **jari** _’finger,’_ you get **jari-jari** which can mean _’fingers’_ or related words like _’spoke’_ and from that meaning _’radius.’_ You can get generic words for groups with rhyming reduplication too, so from **sayur** _’vegetable’_ you can get **sayur-mayur** _’all different kinds of vegetables.’_

Reduplication can repeat the whole word, but it can also just pick out part of a word. You’ve seen reduplication with vowel shifts (tick-tock) and rhyming reduplication (sayur-mayur). You can also get reduplication that just picks out part of a word to repeat. In Marshallese, you can make verbs for ‘to wear a piece of clothing’ by reduplicating the last syllable, so from **takin** _’socks’_ you can derive **takinkin** _’to wear socks.’_

Here are some examples from u/akamchinjir’s conlang Akiatu:

My conlangs often have one or more fairly productive sorts of reduplication---I'm particularly fond of using reduplication to nominalise verbs, for example. But insofar as these are regular, productive processes, I don't really think of them as adding to the lexicon.

You can have idiosyncracies, of course. Like, the usual reduplicated noun based on **píwa** 'eat' is **píwa píwa**, and it just means 'eating,' like in **hau waki píwa píwa** 'I like eating.' But there's also **pipíwa** 'meal,' which uses CV- reduplication (which doesn't normally get used with bisyllabic verbs), and has an unpredictable meaning. Similarly idiosyncratic nominalisations include **kakaunaru** 'excess' (from kaunaru 'overflow'), **mamanai** 'companion' (from manai 'accompany'), and **titasi** 'secret' (from **itasi** 'be hidden').

Akiatu also has a sort of mutating reduplication that's sort of inherently idiosyncratic. This is often used to form intensifiers from adjectives and ideophones. Like, **sakija** is 'red,' and for 'very red,' you use **sakija sajja**. **sajja** can only be used with **sakija**, and though it doesn't follow any really general pattern, it's natural to think of it as a reduplicated form of **sakija**. A couple of other examples of this sort of thing are **amaki mwaki** 'very good' and **tautu tiru** 'be very smelly.' (Possibly related to **tautu** 'be smelly' is **tautau** 'nose.')

Some words formed in roughly this way can be used independently, as ideophones. Here are three examples: **jasijasu** 'colourful' (from **jasi** 'colour'), **kaukai** 'fallen, splayed out' (from **kau** 'fall'), and **rautautau** 'chaotic' (from **rautau** 'multitude').

Akiatu also has a family of resultative complements that have their origin in -CVCV reduplication. This started with an inchoative construction. For example, **suwasu** is 'sleep,' and **suwasu-wasu** is 'fall asleep.' Eventually, some of the CVCV forms produced in this construction could be used with other verbs, and some have taken on idiosyncratic meanings. For example, from **aja** 'throw,' you get **haja** 'away, used up' (the h is inserted to satisfy the CVCV template). It's probably not surprising that **aja-haja** means 'throw away,' but **píwa-haja** 'eat up' involves a semantic extension. Similarly, from **ijau** 'sit' you get **jaku** 'settled, fixed in place' (with an inserted k); you get predictable **ijau**-**jaku** 'sit down,' but also somewhat surprising **acatu-jaku** 'bless.'

I should mention that letting forms originating in reduplication become independent words is pretty odd, except when ideophones and sound symbolism get involved. On the other hand, when ideophones and sound symbolism get involved, it can be pretty common (think of English pairs like 'drip' and 'drop' or 'zig' and 'zag') That's probably not what you think of first when you think of reduplication, but it can be a lot of fun to explore.

One place you find it especially often is in names for animal species; Akiatu has **kuhuhukú** 'owl (species),' **pwipwi** 'mantis (species),' and **warukiwaru** 'chevrotain (species),' for example.

Come come, tell everyone about ways you build words by repeating things. How productive is it? Is it productive productive or is it more willy-nilly? Or do you not take it seriously? Reduplication-shmeduplication. Bye bye!

Tomorrow we’ll talk about **reanalysis**.
