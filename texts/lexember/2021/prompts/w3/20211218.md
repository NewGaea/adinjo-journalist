# BACKFORMATION

**Backformation** is a process born from **reanalysis**, which we talked about earlier this week. Backformations occur when speakers see a word and falsely assume it to be composed of a root and some affixes, then remove the (assumed) affixes to create a root that would have given the same surface form, even though it’s not historically where that came from. For example, ‘backformation’ is a noun that was made by combining ‘back’ and ‘formation.’ But…maybe I see the ‘-ation’ ending and figure it’s a deverbal noun derived from a verb like ‘to backform’ or even ‘to backformate.’ If I said something got backformed, that would be an example of a backformation!

Backformation is common as a regularizing force. English loanwords often get plurals loaned from the source language along with them. If the plurals end in -s, sometimes the original singular form will be replaced by a backformation where you just lop the s off of the plural form. Greek _’syrinx’_ and Spanish _’tamal’_ became English _‘syringe’_ and _‘tamale’_ as backformations from the native plurals _‘syringes’_ and _‘tamales.’_

Sometimes backformation can lead to corresponding pairs of words with different meanings. Latin had a verb _’trānsferō’_ whose past participle was the irregular _’trānslātus_.’ That gave rise to the English word ‘translation,’ which was backformed to give the verb ‘to translate.’ The original verb was separately borrowed into English as ‘to transfer,’ but using its present-tense stem rather than a backformation from its participle!

Backformations are often used humorously too. There are lots of words that look like they’re built using an affix plus another word…just the word they’d be built on either doesn’t exist or has fallen out of use. Gormless people seem like they’d lack ‘gorm’ and disgruntled people could use to be gruntled. Even if corresponding words don’t exist, these processes are transparent enough that speakers can make jokes by coming up with backformations on the fly. And who knows, maybe some of these will stick! I’ve caught myself unironically using ‘heartening,’ a backformed antonym to ‘disheartening.’ If it becomes common enough, people will stop being chalant about it ;)

Late Derplonic, Calantero, and Redstonian by PisuCat

**Late Derplonic: lekyon (noble) -> lekon (giant)**

In Classical Os the word _lékayof_ meant giant. In the south of the Leqan sphere the few giants there acted as an elite, leading to the development in Late Derplonic _lekyon_. As this looked like it had been suffixed with the adjective forming suffix _-yon_ (_< *-yós_), a new word for giant was developed by removing this suffix, giving _lekon_.

**Calantero: lecē (Leqans/giants) -> leci (Leqan/giant)**

Upon direct contact the Redstonians borrowed the Middle Leqan ethnonym _lekē_ into Calantero as _lecē_. In Calantero _-ē_ is almost always encountered as the nominative plural of an _-i_ noun, leading to _lecē_ being interpreted as a plural. The singular _leci_ developed from this as a result, creating a now outdated word for Leqan or giant.

**Redstonian: leĉěn (giant) -> leĉ (Leqan)**

In later Calantero the word _lecino_ came to replace _leci_. This word was semi-borrowed into Redstonian as _leĉěn_, laxing the _i_ and palatalising the _c_, but not the _l_ to distinguish it from _reĉěn_, a giant monster. The _-ěn_ in leĉěn was then interpreted as an augmentative suffix _(< Cal. -ano)_ on the basis of _reĉěn_, where it really was the augmentative, and a new form _leĉ_ developed meaning an ethnic Leqan, while _leĉěn_ solely meant giant.

If you don’t have any examples yet, then backform some for us! I think the Telephone Game is a fun way to make backformations, and when I play I like to look for words that have bits that look like affixes in my conlangs so I can loan them and then create backformations on them. If someone else’s Lexember entries look like they could be reanalyzed in your conlang, then go ahead and telephone off of them and make a new backformation from the result!

In tomorrow’s Lexember prompt, you will find **clitics**.
