# PHATIC PHRASES

> Hello.
>
> How are you?
>
> Have a nice day.

What do those words and phrases mean? Nothing, really, except that you are a polite person and know how to behave in social situations. Phrases that don’t really have much intrinsic meaning, but are used mostly for social function are called phatic expressions.

In English, we have words like the greeting “Hello” and the expression of gratitude “Thank you” (usually followed by “You’re welcome”). These phatic expressions come in many different shapes and styles, such as the famous example from Mandarin Chinese "吃饭了吗" (lit. "have you eaten?") as a rough equivalent to the English “How are you?”

Some languages have phatic expressions for back-channeling (when someone indicates to the speaker that they are listening) such as [Japanese aizuchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aizuchi).

In my conlang, Wistanian, the most often-used phatic expression is _mijim_ which roughly translates to “Thank you.”

> **mijim** \[mɪʒiːm\] _interj._ // thank you; you’re welcome. This is a polite response to reciprocity and kindness, especially after one has had some kind of inconvenience such as doing the speaker a favor, forgiving the speaker, complimenting the speaker, or teaching/warning the speaker. To accept someone’s thanks, _mijim_ is repeated by the one who did the favor.

Differently from “thank you,” however, is that **mijim** is usually a conversation ender, being the last thing a pair of conversational partners say to one another, blending in a meaning of “goodbye” after a friendly interaction. If a speaker wants to thank someone mid-conversation, they would say something like **haulganiya lu** (“You’re kind”).

So what are some common phatic expressions in your conlangs? What words and phrases do speakers use in their day-to-day social interactions to start conversations, end conversations, indicate gratitude, attention, displeasure, confusion, or whatever other emotion they may have?

Tomorrow, we’ll be diving into the nitty-gritty of **grammaticalization**, so I hope you’re ready to take a break(?) from lexicon stuff to make some new grammar.
