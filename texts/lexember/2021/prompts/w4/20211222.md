# GRAMMATICALIZATION

**Grammaticalization** is a process where words that formerly had lexical, non-grammatical meanings come to be used as words (or clitics or affixes) with grammatical meanings. All that grammar’s gotta come from somewhere after all.

One classic example is the English future modal _will_. _Will_ started out his life…or…its life as a full verb meaning ‘to want.’ Saying ‘I will eat cookies’ meant you _Wanted_ to eat cookies, and you could conjugate the verb fully (_to will_: I _will_, thou _wilt_, etc.). Then, it started to lose the sense of ‘want’ and gain a meaning of ‘future tense.’ It stopped being used as the main verb of a clause and lost most of its conjugated forms. Now, instead of being a content word, it’s just a grammatical word used to mark tense.

Grammaticalization can go even further. Many affixes ultimately come from independent words. The Romance languages’ future tense markers come from reduced forms of the verb _‘to have.’_ Forms like _’cantare habeo’_ ‘I-have to-sing’ became reduced to give one-word future tense forms like Italian _canterò_, where the second word became so eroded it ended up just as a suffix. This sort of erosion over time is common as things become more and more grammaticalized.

The opposite process, **degrammaticalization**, is also possible, although rare. Modern Irish innovated a first-person plural pronoun _muid_, which came from a reanalysis of the corresponding verb ending, which is _-mid_ in the present tense. Since Irish is VSO, a verb plus a pronoun sounded similar to a verb plus a personal ending, and the ending ended up breaking off and becoming an independent pronoun!

Here’s an example from u/Cassalalia’s conlang Skysong. Cass shared sound files of their conlang so you can hear what it sounds like! Click on the links for each example to hear a sound file for it.

In Skysong (āɛ̄wēyo /˨˨̠‌˧˧̠‌˩˦˦‌˥˩/), a purely tonal language of flying creatures, objects of verbs may be incorporated to form a compound verb that has one lower valency:

```

I'm carrying rock.
```

```
˨˨̠‌˩˨‌  -˦‌˦˨˨‌˨˦‌    ˩‌˩˨‌˨˩‌
rock-carry 1S
I'm rock-carrying, i.e. I'm performing hard, boring labor.
```

The impersonal voice was formed through the grammaticalization of object incorporation of the word for the cardinal number one (aʔ /˨‌·/ when independent, ā /˨˨̠‌) when incorporated)

want NPR-sleep A 1S
I want to be sleeping.
```

A second form of the impersonal was then formed by reduplication of the first one or two morae of the verb, perhaps through a reanalysis or shortening of the emphatic impersonal. The second form of the impersonal and empathetic forms can thus be identical, but the emphatic takes an object while the impersonal does not.

```
˦˩˩‌~  ˦˩˩‌˧˩˩‌
NPR~sleep
There is sleeping
```

Both forms of the impersonal are synonymous and are used in free variation, with one being chosen over the other to avoid ambiguity, less desirable rhythms, or just by convention or personal preference.

Have you had any interesting instances of grammaticalization in your conlang? Any content words becoming grammatical words or even affixes are welcome! Lexember is all about creating lexemes rather than ‘words’ (whatever those are), so bound forms can be fine!
