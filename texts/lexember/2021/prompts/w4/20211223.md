# EUPHEMISMS

Cover your kids’ eyes folks, cause it’s about to get graphic! But like, in a polite sort of way. Today we’re talking about **euphemisms**, words that are used as stand-ins for other words considered too impolite to mention.

All cultures have taboos. What things are taboo is hardly universal, but it does seem to be universal that there are things considered inappropriate to talk about. In the Anglo world, bodily functions and sex are taboo, and it’s not considered polite to talk about them. That’s part of why words like ‘fuck’ and ‘shit’ are swear words. But most of us fuck and most of us shit, so we need to find ways to talk about these things indirectly when they come up. Euphemisms are indirect ways of referring to these things, like ‘to sleep with someone’ and ‘to go to the bathroom,’ which allow us to avoid using taboo words or mentioning taboo subjects directly. Metonymy is a particularly common way to make euphemisms, since it allows clear reference to the inappropriate or taboo thing without actually referring to it.

Sometimes words that start out as euphemisms become taboo themselves, so you people need a new euphemism. This leads to a euphemism cycle. An example is ‘toilet,’ which started out as a euphemism, but eventually came to refer to the object in the bathroom, and has mostly been replaced by other euphemisms, like ‘bathroom’ or ‘restroom.’

**Newclogn** by MatzahDog

**_Newcmokné_** is a compound noun derived from _newc_, the “all” quantifier, and _mokné_, the manmade location classifier. Like other words derived from _newc_, it has meanings related to archeology and geology; literally, it means “digsite” or “archeological site”. Additionally, however, _newcmokné_ is used as a euphemism for “gravesite”. Although graves aren’t typically considered taboo in Newclogn culture, it’s considered impolite to discuss the gravesite of someone who has died in the presence of that someone’s close relatives. As such, when talking to someone about their family member’s grave, instead of using the typical word for “grave”, _qïsz maq̇në́_, you use _newcmokné_.

**_Id’yú_** literally means “to pollinate”, and most frequently refers to the pollination of flowers by animals such as hummingbirds and butterflies. It can also be used as a euphemism for “sex”, replacing the typical word, _ho7ë́döm juu_. In Newclogn culture, it’s considered inappropriate to discuss sex around children, for fear of damaging the perceived innocence of childhood, and as such, a euphemism must be used.

**_Mar maknë́ molcou_** is a noun phrase literally translated as “an innocent hearth”; _mar maknë́_ means “hearth”, _cou_ means “to be innocent, and _mol_ is an agreement marker. When someone has a _mar maknë́ molcou_, however, it’s a polite way of saying that they aren’t living in the real world, and as such don’t understand the struggles or challenges people face. Their home is innocent because it’s been unscathed by the hardships of life. If while talking to a Newclogn speaker, you’re told that you have a _mar maknë́ molcou_, they’re implying that you should stop speaking, as you clearly don’t understand the issue you’re discussing.

Euphemisms tell us a lot about attitudes towards different subjects. What sorts of topics require euphemistic speech in your conculture? What sorts of expressions do your speakers use to get around them?

Now we’ll go from avoiding things to be polite to emphasizing things to be polite. Tomorrow we’ll talk about **honorifics**.
