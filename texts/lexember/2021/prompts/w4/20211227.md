BROADENING AND NARROWING

The reason I’m putting these together is that we’ve already kinda talked about this with hypernyms and hyponyms earlier this month. Review: a hypernym is a word with a broad sense (e.g., “color”) while a hyponym is a word with a narrow sense (e.g., “red,” “yellow,” “green,” “blue,” etc.). **Broadening and narrowing** is simply the process of semantic change when a word’s sense alternates in specificity.

When a lexeme’s sense **broadens**, it becomes less specific. When it **narrows**, it becomes more specific. For example, the word “mouse” has experienced both semantic broadening and narrowing throughout its history. In Old English, the word _“mus”_ referred not only to the small rodent, but also to the muscles of the upper arm, apparently by analogy that the flexing of an arm is similar to the movement of a mouse. We got our word for “muscle” from the Latin _“musculus”_ which was a diminutive meaning “little mouse,” then _“mus”_ narrowed to only refer to the small rodent.

Fast forward a few centuries to 1965. We’ve had some vowel shifts happen so the word is now “mouse” (with the irregular plural mice) and we have since invented computers. Two computer engineers named Bill English and Douglas Engelbart invent a device for selecting a specific point in a computer display. The device is small, round, and uses a cord similar to a tail. They call it a _“mouse,”_ again by analogy, and the name stuck. “Mouse” has now semantically broadened.

+ _“Starve”_ used to mean “to die,” but has since narrowed to “to die of hunger.”
+ _“Holiday”_ (from a blend of “holy” and “day”) used to refer only to religious celebrations but has since broadened to include any culturally significant day.
+ _“Meat”_ used to refer to any food, but has since narrowed to only include food that is from the flesh of an animal.
+ _“Picture”_ used to refer to a painting, but has since broadened to include any type of visual representation, painted or photographed.

You get the drift? Sometimes semantic broadening can become semantic bleaching where a word will broaden so much that it means both everything and nothing. For example, _“thing”_ used to refer to an assembly, but now it means… whatever you want it to mean, really.

So, it’s time to _narrow_ into your conlang’s lexicon and _broaden_ it. What are some examples of semantic narrowing and broadening in your language’s history? Does it result in any interesting “splits” like “mouse” and “muscle” (or “poison” and “potion” from yesterday’s prompt)?

Tomorrow, we’ll take a break from semantic shifts and talk about **collocations**.
