# HONORIFICS

When addressing people of different social status, most cultures will have special words called honorifics to use in order to refer to that person with due respect. In English, the most common honorifics are “_Mister_” and “_Miss_,” usually used by children to adult superiors. However, we also have “_Doctor_,” “_Professor_,” “_Coach_,” “_Officer_,” “_The Honorable_” and all sorts of others.

The number and usage of honorifics varies widely across languages. Sometimes they’re mandatory, other times they're only used in certain contexts by certain people. Sometimes the rules are rigid, other times there’s ideolectal variation. In some languages there are a lot of honorifics, in others there are very few. Sometimes the usage of honorifics will be reflected in the grammar of the entire sentence. Regardless, every society has some sort of social hierarchy that is reflected in their language. Even more egalitarian societies will refer to their peers with honorifics like “brother/sister” or “comrade.”

Here are some examples of honorifics from Otseqon created by Pecan:

**-cʼan** \[ʦʼaŋ\] is an Otseqon honorific used to refer to people politely and relatively neutrally, that is, out of the honorifics it probably implies the least about the speaker's relationship with the referent. It is usable both for people you know and people you do not know, however, for people you are relatively close to it de-emphasizes your relationship with them and therefore it is not used in situations like among friends to address friends. -cʼan generally only attaches to family names, including in cases where the full name is specified, e.g. _Kasawicʼanka e ti Ŋǀaaya ‘Ŋǀaaya Kasawi’_ (`kasawi-cʼan-ka e ti ŋǀaaya family_name-HON-3POSS DAT DET given_name`—syntactically this is the construction used for inalienable possession in general). In such cases it can also attach to both names, but is rarely if ever used on given names alone.

When referring to multiple people _-cʼan_ is partially reduplicated to _-cacʼan_ \[ʦaʦʼaŋ\], which is a sort of polite associative plural: _Kasawicacʼan_ ‘Mr Kasawi et al’

_-cʼan_ often occurs with other politeness-related morphology. It can co-occur with a general politeness marker _haC-_ (C being gemination of the following consonant), which also occurs on family names to confer an additional level of respect and can occur on many words to make them more polite. (It also occurs as a fossilized derivational prefix on some words, loosely, it derives idiosyncratic "more specific" versions of words.) _Hakkasawicʼan_ is basically the same as _Kasawicʼan_ but makes him sound more important. _-cʼan_ also often occurs with the honorific verb morphology _-ra-n_ (composed of -CAUS-REFL, but has an honorific meaning beyond its use as valency morphology).

**_-ci_** \[ʨi\] is a different Otseqon honorific which primarily attaches to given names and is usually used for kids and young women. It is much more friendly, and you wouldn't use it to refer to strangers, but is normally used among people who know each other relatively well.
