# MELIORATION

Merry Christmas, Nerds! Since today’s the merriest of days, we’re gonna do the merriest of lexical shifts–merryation…or uh…**melioration**. Since today’s a holiday for a lot of you, we’ll keep it brief. Brief is a cognate with merry after all (both from PIE _*mréǵʰus_ meaning ‘short’), so I ought to wish you a Brief Christmas too.

**Melioration** is a shift where a word comes to mean something nicer than what it originally meant. For example ‘nice’ used to mean ‘ignorant,’ then its meaning got softened to ‘simple, foolish’ and eventually it came around and started to mean ‘kind’ or ‘good’!

Melioration is fairly common in positive slang words like _sick_, _nasty_, _gnarly_, _(the) shit_, and even _bad_ can mean 'good!'

Sometimes melioration is an active process. In the case of reclamation, people take a word that’s used as an insult, and start using it positively to try and improve its connotation. A recent example of that is _‘queer,’_ which was an insult a generation or two ago. LGBT people started using it and it got **‘meliorated’** enough that a Q got added on to the acronym! At this point, half the r/conlangs mod team would say they’re queer without any notion of it as an insult.

Here are some examples of melioration from u/ratsawn:

Over time, many Yajéé words have meliorated into softer, calmer, or less violent meanings than they had in Proto-Yajéé.

In some cases, these words changed from a negative meaning to a positive one. For example, **pidada** ‘to be wise’ came from PY **pitataa** ‘to be very old’, **rös** ‘to hunt (an animal)’ from PY **rose** ‘to kill (someone), **ę̈nes** ‘to be asleep’ from PY **onnasi** ‘to be dead’, and **‘oyöön** ‘to discuss’ came from PY **‘olōnte** ‘to argue.

In other cases, a neutral meaning developed into one with positive connotations. For instance, **lür** ‘to give’ came from PY **lori** ‘to slide’ and **miróm** ‘helpful spirit’ came from PY’s catch-all term for any spirit, good or bad, **mi’rompo**.

Meliorry Christmas everyone! Tomorrow things are getting worse as we go from melioration to **pejoration**.
