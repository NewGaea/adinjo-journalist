# PEJORATION

Today, we’ll be talking about the opposite of melioration: **pejoration**, which is when a lexeme’s meaning is downgraded or given a more negative meaning. Many times, pejoratives begin as euphemisms (Day 23) for a taboo word, then eventually become themselves taboo. Sometimes, words are turned into pejoratives against certain groups of people in order to use language as a weapon against them. For example, yesterday we used the reclamation of _“queer”_ by the LGBT+ community as an example of melioration. Before that, however, _“queer”_ had undergone a process of pejoration from meaning “strange, odd, unwell” to becoming a slur for homosexual people in the late 19th century. Pejoration (and melioration) can be good tools for seeing what a language community values and devalues.

For example, there is a very worrying and ancient trend of pejoration toward _feminine_ terms in English (and many other languages). When you look at masculine-feminine word pairs, it’s clear that feminine terms are more likely to undergo pejoration. For example, compare _“lord”_ and _“lady.”_ _“Lord”_ refers to a ruler or a master (typically male), while _“lady”_ is just a rough and informal way to refer to a woman (e.g., “Hey, lady!”). Then you have _“master”_ and _“mistress”_: again, a _“master”_ is someone in charge while a _“mistress”_ is a woman having an affair with a married man. Both _“bachelor”_ and _“spinster”_ refer to unmarried men and women, respectively, but a _bachelor_ is young and desirable while a _spinster_ is old and undesirable.

Other times pejoration just happens. _“Silly”_ used to mean “happy, prosperous” then underwent a number of semantic shifts until we land in its current pejorative meaning, “goofy, foolish.” The word _“disease”_ is also a pejorative from the Old French word for “discomfort.” The word _“poison”_ came from an Old French word that referred to any medicinal drink, which came from the PIE root _“*po(i)-”_ (“drink”) (also where we get the word for “potion,” fun fact). The last example I’ll throw at you is the meaning of the word _“villain”_ which was pejorated from _“scoundrel”_ which was pejorated from _“peasant”_ which was pejorated from _“farmhand”_ or, more specifically, “someone who works in a villa.”

Here are some examples from u/henrywongtsh:

In the Hong Kong variety of the posterior Sinitic conlang Nanyue, we have the word :

**daay1** /daːj˦/ (歹)

1. to die (vulgar; colloquial)
2. to cause oneself to die (vulgar; colloquial; derogatory)

This is a loan from Proto-Austronesian (possibly via Chamic) _*matay_ “to die” and pejoration of this term mainly happened due to the following three factors :

a) The Chinese’s general avoidance and taboo on death and related terms

b) There exists many words for “death” in Nanyue, which encouraged negative semantic shift : 死 _si2_ “to die (generic)”; 卒 _tsut8_ “to die respectfully; to die in battle”; 吧/歹巴 _pjae1_ “to die of illness”; 口免/歹免 _min1_ “to die of poison” etc

And c) increased pejorative use due to similarities to English “die” and “died” as a result of early resistance to British rule

So, yesterday, you had a Merry Christmas and today you have a Miserable Crisis. Regardless, I can't wait to see what awful (**pejorative** of its original meaning “full of awe”) lexemes you create today.

See you tomorrow where we’ll do a double feature: semantic **broadening** and **narrowing**.
