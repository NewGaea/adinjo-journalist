# COLLOCATIONS

Lexicon isn’t just built on the level of words. There are some parts of the lexicon made up of multiple words, like **collocations**. A collocation is a phrase whose parts occur together more often than chance would predict. The meaning of a collocation is predictable based on the meanings of its components, unlike idioms, which are phrases with unpredictable meanings.

Some collocations refer to specific, culturally known things. _‘Dark chocolate’_ is common even though ‘light chocolate’ is not. Other collocations are fairly independent of culture, and are just fixed phrases, often picking out one word from a set of synonyms. I’d say ‘fast’ and ‘quick’ are broadly synonyms, but if I went to McDonalds to get some _quick food_ for a _fast snack_, you’d know something was off. I should be getting _fast food_ for a _quick snack_!

One way you can think about certain types of collocations is that they consist of a base word and a modifier function. You might have a function that takes a word and returns the appropriate intensifier (secret > _top secret_, problem > _major problem_, hot > _piping hot_, black > _pitch black_) or one that takes a noun and returns the appropriate action verb (question > _ask a question_, party > _throw a party_, decision > _make a decision_, nap > _take a nap_). You can think of these more general constructions while you’re conlanging to come up with the sorts of collocations you might need.

Here are some examples of collocations from my own conlang, Mwaneḷe. (Not because we didn’t have any submissions for today, I just submitted these to Page as examples before I knew which prompts I’d be writing!) Some of these examples were featured in [William Annis's LCC9](https://youtu.be/xuZ_q6_BXXY) talk, which is a good intro to different types of collocation.

It's common for words to collocate with specific intensifiers. Mwaneḷe loves verb serialization, so there are several verbs which are intensified by serialization with specific other verbs. For example **kiḷe** _'to know'_ is intensified with **boto** _'to master a skill'_ to give **kiḷe boto** _'to know for sure,'_ **gepwu** _'to stop'_ is intensified with **ŋwelok** _'to fall down'_ to give **gepwu ŋwelok** _'to come to a screeching halt,'_ and **emeŋi** _'to run'_ is intensified with **mebi** _'to be awake'_ to give **emeŋi mebi** _'to sprint.'_ Each of these pairs is lexically specified—none of the secondary verbs can be used with any of the other primary verbs, and none of them are general intensifiers. If someone said **emeŋi ŋwelok** it could only have its literal meaning _'to run and fall down,'_ since **ŋwelok** doesn't collocate with emeŋi.

Nouns can also collocate with specific intensifiers, which are usually adjectives in Mwaneḷe. One place you can see this is that different nouns will take different adjectives describing size. A tall person is **ŋin owowu**, a tall mountain is **baxo xas**, and a tall house is **kasa te**. Each of **owowu**, **xas**, and **te** could be translated as 'tall,' but they collocate with different sorts of nouns: **owowu** is only used to describe the height of animals and people (and more nearly means long), while **xas** is often used with geological features, spaces, receptacles, and a few other things. Expressions like this aren't really idioms—their meanings clearly arise as combinations of the meanings of their components. But speakers would consider some of these combinations to be natural and others to be unnatural.

Another type of collocation involves nouns selecting verbs to refer to the action you'd expect to do with them. In English, you get this with different light verbs: you take a shower, have a conversation, throw a party, hold a reception, make a decision, and so on. All of those are lexically specified—in another language you might give a party or take a decision. Mwaneḷe tends to lexicalize actions as verbs rather than by using a light verb + noun combo, but there are a few cases where nouns select certain verbs. The noun **ṣalo** _'task, errand'_ takes the verb **kwole** _'to work'_ to make the expression **kwole ṣalo** _'to run errands.'_ Similarly there's no verb for _'to dream,'_ just the noun **iŋoje** _'dream,'_ but you can say **in iŋoje** _'to sleep a dream.'_

Alright, let’s collocate!

Any guesses for tomorrow’s topic? Ding ding ding! It’s **ideophones**.
