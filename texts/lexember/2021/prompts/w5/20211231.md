# IDIOMS

An **idiom** is a person who forgets to schedule the final Lexember post so that it has to go out a few hours earlier than normal. Sorry.

But no, really, our final topic for the month is **idioms**, a phrase that has a special meaning separate from what can be deduced from its words. Idioms are widely considered to be lexemes because they are ‘non-compositional’ meaning that their parts don’t contribute to the meaning of the whole. Just as ‘ca’ doesn’t contribute anything to the meaning of ‘cats,’ the word ‘cats’ doesn’t contribute meaning to the idiom _‘it’s raining cats and dogs.’_ You have to memorize the entire phrase and its special meaning or else you’ll interpret it literally and be very confused. Idioms have been the bane of language learners for millenia.

Of course, just because they’re non-compositional doesn’t mean they’re totally illogical. Most idioms have a (sometimes disputed) traceable origin from literature, history, or culture. Other times, they are born as a simple metaphor until they are canonized as a widely agreed-upon non-compositional idiom. The ‘cats and dogs’ idiom for example has many possible origins from history and mythology, but - in my amateur opinion - it likely just started as a simple metaphor that became popular and lexicalized.

Here’s an example of an idiom from Žskđ by u/f0rm0r

```
  Znʀ’šđlxŋfđ     sfrpsđ     psrz     zŋl  m?
[ˈznʀ̩ʔʃðɫ̩xŋ̍fð̩    ˈsfr̩psð̩     psr̩z     zŋ̍ˈl‿m̩]
eel-GEN-king-DAT  crest-ABS  red-ABS  be-M.PRS-NEG=Q
Doesn't the King of Eels have a red crest?
```

I made this idiom as a calque from the English phrase "Is the Pope Catholic?" so it's used as a sarcastic retort when someone says something obvious. In the same way that everyone in Western culture knows that the Pope is Catholic, everyone in Birch Forest culture knows that the mythological figure of the King of Eels, who is inspired by tales of oarfish sightings, so he has a red crest. Though not the most original, this idiom demonstrates how tied idioms can be to cultural knowledge.

So, don’t give this final Lexember prompt the cold shoulder and let’s wrap this up! If you’re drawing a blank, play it by ear and I’m sure you’ll pass with flying colors. This will be a piece of cake!

With that, we’ll call it a month. I hope you’ve had a happy Lexember, a happy holiday season, and I wish you all a tolerable 2022.

As they say in my conlang,
**liya bi** (good flying)
