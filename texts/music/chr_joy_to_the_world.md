# Joy to the World

```txt
Kein hem muri, Ajan ic nath: Baetochi Hiro?
Amori kasalm aurok in'dji, a Korem hi nahertu,
a korem hi nahertu, a korem hi nahertu shoketochi.

Kein hem muri, Khrist al'maru: Adan shoketochi,
Ma ju, lornu hi twaru, nochu hi djanenu adul,
Shoketochi in feis, shoketochi in feis, hi ayugi shoketochi in feis!

Polt hi keran kulochi'ha, jalu fanguen tonstoch!
Sukan hemlol kason mokuron kuki tenatol,
Gubra ki jenes ni polt, gubra ki jenes ni polt, techi, gubra aki jenes ni polt.

Khi'ich al'maru kuki muri, khaf hi porhel ic kuKhi,
Kumuri adan bacitochi,
```

He rules the world
With truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of
His righteousness
And wonders of his love
And wonders of his love
And wonders, and wonders of his love
