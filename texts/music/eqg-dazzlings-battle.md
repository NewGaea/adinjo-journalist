# Battle

```
We heard you want to get together
Ci varmel'hemlé, ki jimartot.

We heard you want to rock the school
Chennur 'Hai!' yanis ki jimar.

We've thought of something that is better
Ki yugi sayrindul minitot,

Something that changes all the rules
A'alnomu julaxtochi.
```

```
Why pretend we're all the same,
Aur sif adin orom yan,

When some of us shine brighter?
Cori ki ellorekdul

Here's a chance to find your flame:
Ju yi kuyi gif a-irend:

Are you a loser or a fighter?
Aur yi toxdin yr dorja icdul?
```

```
Me and you, you and me,
Yi'hèm ci, ci'hèm yi,

Why don't we see who is better?
Aur ci wi sa'yrin tonsen?

We don't have to be one and the same thing.
Ki win hi orom ha yac gyumitol'a

Oh what's so wrong with a little competition?
A aur kue walu sen'gyuré ni ankoro?

Are you afraid of failing the audition?
Aur yi sug campan tox i rentolodul?
```

```
You're a star and you should know it.
Yi dan kendan ic hi xi ijin.

Yeah, you rise above the rest.
Téch, yi qinu xaji'i

It doesn't matter who you hurt,
Ba leka'e ni shi'hèm forton

if you're just proving you're the best.
Kuyi ansayoch ducabix.
```

[Spoken] (between chanting "Lekake!" and "Kempoc!")
I can beat you!
Yi ci'tak shenzatochi

Hah! You wish!
Wè! Yi kiréton!

I so want this!
Yi hach kiréntondyur!

Not if I get it first!
Sif yi xi bortochi, ci boraka!
```

Me and you, you and me,
