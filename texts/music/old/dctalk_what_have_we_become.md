## DC Talk's _What Have We Become_

```txt
A preacher shuns his brother
Because his bride's a different color;
And this is not acceptable,
His papa taught him so.

It was love that he'd been preaching,
But this was overreaching;
The boundaries stretching further
Than his heart would choose to go.

Like an angel with no wings
Like a kingdom with no king

[C1]
What have we become?
A self indulgent people.
What have we become?
Tell me where are the righteous ones?
What have we become?
In a world degenerating,
What have we become?

[C2]
Speak your mind, look out for yourself
The answer to it all is a life of wealth
Grab all you can cause you just live once
You got the right to do whatever you want
Don't worry about others or where you came from
It ain't what you were, it's what you have become

Mom and Dad are fighting,
As Rosie lies there crying;
For once again she's overheard
Regrets of their mistake.

With Christmas bells a-ringing,
Little Rosie'd leave them grieving
The gift she'd give her family
Would be the pills she'd take

An inconvenient child
She wasn't worth their while

(repeat choruses 1 and 2)

What about love?
What about God?
What about holiness?
What about mercy, compassion and selflessness?

You know it's true
He is there for me and you
Doesn't matter what you do

(repeat chorus 1)

What have we become?
Have we come undone?
[repeat x3]

(repeat chorus 2)

Selfish...
With selfish...
Selfish people
When you gonna learn?
Everyone of us
Gathered 'round in trust
What have we become?
```

```txt
A priest ignores his brother
who has married someone Other
This marriage is improper,
was their father's attitude.

He speaks a message of love,
but this is not allowed:
This pushes the fence inwards,
suffocating his heart.

Like a wingless bird,
Like a kingless land

What are we now?
Indolent and ignorant?
What are we now?
Speak up! Where are the righteous?
What are we now?
In this world of permissiveness,
what are we now?

Speak your thoughts, defend yourself
The only solution is to live in gold
Fill your hands in this one life,
Freedom is the right to live your whims
Others are a burden, so is the past,
The future will erase all of that.

Mother and father shout,
as Rosie lies in tears:
Again she's heard them
lament their "big mistake."

As the Gift Festival approaches,
Little Rosie chooses their tears:
Her gift to her family will
be her bloodstained bed.

An unwanted child,
she'd waste their time no more.

What is love?
Where are the gods?
We've lost our righteousness.
We've lost mercy, compassion, and self-sacrifice

Know the truth:
We must raise ourselves up,
in order to improve this world.

Dan koen trellets ji cin
Kuji kendai ica Adin;
Hi ba ica humaren
Kuji poren kamput.

Ji ins liktol failes
Kend ba ins allarames;
Sug aure bolotol dai ji
Kuji mori joren'ha.

Lin korja a deham.
Lin larijmo a hiro.

Que ic ku'i ju?
Dan langurin din.
Que ic ku'i ju?
Kampis; dán ic sug omaki din?
Que ic ku'i ju?
Ni dan muri daheretol
Que ic ku'i ju?

Yani minits zenton jun lin'yi
Sug aknamarg ich jeneru ni gilden
Uren yugisu yi jenera kabu winau
Yi ic libron kempo que yi falc
Qui takama minit ha sug furi:
Que yi icins atakama nyuma que yi tonston.

Medra Poren lekakel
[Hi] Kaumé aruse sentol;
Janyu fi jimarut del shi
Kejé kushi midokh.

Hort Banchi-jia freijol,
Kaumé'tal shi kason sento:
Kufi banchi hem sug réjo,
Dan dokre ni [sug] mori.

Dan kendis ha kani,
Ins ha hort kushi temba.

Delman failes?
Delman Khi'ich?
Delman andenin?
Delman graumi hi yumare hi juragin?

Techi khich nam,
   Khi'ich failon yi hen chi
Ayugi chi kempo
