| Proud and so glorious | _gelm hi feisa'udur_ | kuki'kérin reztol |
| Standing before of us | _reztol kérin iki_ | gelm hi feisa'un hort, |
| Our swords will shine bright in the sky | _ki ten iptochi ni sug rom_ | Ten kuki rom'ni iptoçi |
| | | |
| When united we come | _monsi winlin ki'hem_ | KUKUHA LARIJMO |
| To the land of the sun | _le sug kuha larij(mo)_ | hem ki winlin hemlé |
| With the heart of a dragon we ride | _hort sug kudreik mori ki sedra_ | ki mori kudreik hort senodrac |
| | | |
| We are flying on wings in winter sky | _kich kirmeltol dai deham shukarom_ | ki dehamu dai shukarom akar, |
| With fire burning deep inside | _hort gif 'etol iljye nikar_ | |
| We are warriors of endless time forever and on | _kich dorjaxe i atemba atemba hi goju_ | |
| | | |
| On wings of steel an ancient flight | _deham i exan aldyur nakirm_ | |
| We see the powers that unite | _bachton deirin ira kson winlin_ | |
| The gods will now send us a sign of battle once more | _Teolu borchto ju ki morent lekaké janyu_ | |

Through the valley we ride
Full of glory we soar
Where the fights will be raging
For now and for more
When united we come
and divided they fall
Tonight you will witness it all

Proud and so glorious
Standing before of us
Our swords will shine bright in the sky
When united we come
To the land of the sun
With the heart of a dragon we ride

A land unknown we come so far
We ride the night till morning star
When colours fade to black and white
Your eyes come to sight

With the vision of a great divide
You turn towards the other side
You think you run but you can't hide
The dead can not ride

Through the valley we ride
Full of glory we soar
Where the fights will be raging
For now and for more
When united we come
and divided they fall
Tonight you will witness it all

Proud and so glorious
Standing before of us
Our swords will shine bright in the sky
When united we come
To the land of the sun
With the heart of a dragon we ride

Over high seas and mountains
We fly to the heavens
On wings of a dragon tonight

Proud and so glorious
Standing before of us
Our swords will shine bright in the sky
Proud and so glorious
Standing before of us
Our swords will shine bright in the sky
When united we come
To the land of the sun
With the heart of a dragon...
The heart of a dragon...
The heart of a dragon we ride...
