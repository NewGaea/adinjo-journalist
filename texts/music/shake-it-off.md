A translation of Taylor Swift's *Shake it Off* into Adinjo Journalist, circa December 2023.

I stay out too late
Got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say, mm-mm
I go on too many dates (Haha)
But I can't make them stay
At least, that's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say, mm-mm

\[Verse 1]
Acoci monsi domyema,

Kend shi atemba xuneton,
Ma xi dynu yanitol, mm-mm

\[Pre-Chorus]
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', "It's gonna be alright"

\[Pre-Chorus]

\[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

\[Verse 2]
I never miss a beat
I'm lightnin' on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mm-mm
That's what they don't see, mm-mm
I'm dancin' on my own (Dancin' on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (Moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mm-mm
That's what they don't know, mm-mm

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend

And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
