## Translated English Text

Oh cat, cat, black cat,
If you make a little sound,
My little brother will awaken and
He has the power of a gross of tigers.

Cat, cat, white cat,
You are the intense hunter.
Your grace is like the
Tiger when he goes on
The hunt for four meals.

Black cat, cat of white,
Imperial among the beasts.
Creature of beauty, beast of power,
One is white as snow, one black as
The pit. Will you be a friend?
