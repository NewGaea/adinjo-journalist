# Original Poem: _Hyma Ci Koru_

## Original Adinjo Text

```txt
Gurion hiro ic dan karen,
Miktan hi curito.
Zus Sonhir sug kemitakh,
Ton Olímpús ramintot.

Kame sino, kuZus shir,
Kemi ton kufi loji kenz.
Hira Sonhir sug kharon,
Ton Olímpús fritot kufi twa.

Hefastus, sug cintal,
Hiro i sug gif hi gifan,
Ji ins baton kuji shir,
kenji ins tokh.

Hiro Hediz i sug jamdukal,
Sorok inda Olímpús.
```
