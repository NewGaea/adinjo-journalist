# Lexember 2018: Final Report

It’s here. It’s time. Congratulations to all of our participants, and thank you for your entries and for your upvotes. Even though activity predictably tanked after Day 4, the entire month was filled with fun, challenge, discussion, and learning about one another. I couldn’t be happier that we were able to enjoy it together.

+ [u/upallday_allen](https://www.reddit.com/u/upallday_allen/)’s [entry, which was the first and most popular entry of the entire month](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/a230wn/lexember_2018_day_1/eaup6yv/). This will be my only self-promotion, I promise. (**Day 1**)
+ [u/Orientalis_lacus](https://www.reddit.com/u/Orientalis_lacus/)’s [jaw-dropping entry about a local dish in Heraen culture](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/a310nu/lexember_2018_day_4/eb33vlf/). It’s probably my favorite entry of the entire month. (**Day 4**)

+ [u/Orientalis_lacus](https://www.reddit.com/u/Orientalis_lacus/) is back at it again [with a beautiful description of a Heraen game](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/a40rss/lexember_2018_day_7/ebaxzec/). (**Day 7**)

+ [u/Cuban_Thunder](https://www.reddit.com/u/Cuban_Thunder/)’s [entry in which he coins sixty-six new words](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/a5kaho/lexember_2018_day_12/ebo0rq9/)! (**Day 12**)
+ [u/validated-vexer](https://www.reddit.com/u/validated-vexer/) and I did not plan this; but, as luck would have it, [we were able to be serenaded with Modern Tialenan adpositions at the most perfect time](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/a6p8w7/lexember_2018_day_16/ebx4mj6/). (**Day 16**)
+ [u/roipoiboy](https://www.reddit.com/u/roipoiboy/)’s [personalized entry, listing the things that he needs to pack before going on his own journey](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/a7cj0v/lexember_2018_day_18/ec2jkjt/). Also includes a friendly discussion about gift-giving and In-N-Out with [u/boomfruit](https://www.reddit.com/u/boomfruit/). (**Day 18**)
+ Also by [u/roipoiboy](https://www.reddit.com/u/roipoiboy/), [a list of hedges](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/a8ab6g/lexember_2018_day_21/ec9k7ro/). Like, literal hedges, not linguistic ones. (**Day 21**)
+ [u/ndagyu](https://www.reddit.com/u/ndagyu/)’s [interesting and detailed entry on ‘giving’ in Lhefsoni](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/a9eqgs/lexember_2018_day_25/ecj6coz/). (**Day 25**)
+ [u/IHCOYC](https://www.reddit.com/u/IHCOYC/)’s [fun read about giving traditions and chess pieces in Tengkolaku](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/a9eqgs/lexember_2018_day_25/eckiz0x/). (**Day 25**)
+ [u/roipoiboy](https://www.reddit.com/u/roipoiboy/)’s [description of a local language game](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/a9yv6k/lexember_2018_day_27/ecoaokv/) which later turned into a [really interesting discussion post](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/aa1ybw/what_language_games_do_you_have_in_your_conlang/). (**Day 27**)
+ [u/Cuban_Thunder](https://www.reddit.com/u/Cuban_Thunder/)’s post about the year past and the year coming, special because it was the very last entry submitted just moments before voting was closed, and it includes a total number of 435 coined Lexember words. Congratulations! (**Day 31**)

## Winners!

This month saw some incredible entries from very talented artists, and it’s a shame that many of them were not able to climb to the top. I am confident when saying that the Top Ten have demonstrated effort, commitment, ingenuity, and creativity that inspired me as I read through them, as did many others that didn’t make it. At the end of the day, what matters is the conlanging, not the competition.

### First Runner-Up

In second place, **Laetia** by [u/Haelaenne](https://www.reddit.com/u/Haelaenne/) with 103 points. This conlang, adorned with a gorgeous Javanese-inspired script, consistently stole the show with high-effort entries that were a joy to read.

### First Place

**In first place, please join me in congratulating [u/roipoiboy](https://www.reddit.com/u/roipoiboy/)!**

**Mwaneḷe** has won the month with 110 points! The entries were consistent, well-thought, and well-received this month, contributing to the contest an essential touch of professionalism and personality. I don’t know about you, but reading them was almost always inspiring to me, and I believe that this conlang deserves the win. Its creator has acquired the highly coveted golden flair. Congratulations!
