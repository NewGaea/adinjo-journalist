# Personal Names, Noises/Onomatopoeia & Euphemisms

+ Coin a list of names that may be used in your conculture. [For some classic r/conlangs inspiration…](https://redd.it/8pymk3)
+ Coin terms for different types of noises. E.g., bang, shriek, squeal, hum, etc. With this, you can have plenty of fun with [onomapotopapeoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomatopoeia). (I can never spell the word right, so I’ve just sorta owned it and moved on.) Yes, this can include animal noises.
+ Create one or more [euphemisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism).

## RESOURCE!

I know the first prompt about names is a big one that may require some extra creative thinking. Combined with the linked thread and [this handy document about naming customs all around the real world](https://www.fbiic.gov/public/2008/nov/Naming_practice_guide_UK_2006.pdf), I hope you find plenty of inspiration!
