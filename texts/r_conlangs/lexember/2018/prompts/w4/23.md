[Graded Sentences for Analysis](http://www.potterpcs.net/gsfa/), a collection of example sentences that will test your syntax and morphology, but can also be used to build up basic vocabulary. I highly recommend it, although be aware that these sentences may have an English bias. Your language may not make a distinction that these sentences do, or maybe have more distinctions than these sentences will cover. Itâ€™s a tool, not a guide.
