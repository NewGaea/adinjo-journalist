## FEEDBACK REQUEST

If you haven’t already, please be sure to fill out the Lexember 2018: Survey. Tell me what you loved, what you hated, and what you’d like to see next year. (Editor's Note: Link excluded; though the survey is still live it is quite untimely), even if you didn’t participate that much (or at all)
