It's the most wonderful time of the year! (...which isn't saying much considering the year we've had.)

Once again, [r/conlangs](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/) is hosting **Lexember**, an annual month-long event with the purpose of growing our conlangs' lexicons. (Lexicon + December = Lexember).

The idea is to **create at least one word every day**. Here at [r/conlangs](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/), we take that idea a step further and offer prompts to help you think about your lexicon at large. Each year has been bigger and better, and this time it's no different. Not only are we providing prompts, but we're also providing them as a resource that you can come back to whenever you need some help thinking through your lexicon. I'd like to thank the mod team, especially [u/roipoiboy](https://www.reddit.com/u/roipoiboy/), [u/Cawlo](https://www.reddit.com/u/Cawlo/), and [u/chrsevs](https://www.reddit.com/u/chrsevs/), for helping me put these posts together because... let me tell you... they're quite a bit of work.

Each day, we'll be taking on a different "lexical field." Those are categories that we often use to organize our vocabularies. For example, the first day's prompt (spoiler alert) will be on the COSMOS, and we'll talk about how different languages and cultures might understand and lexify terms for the heavenly bodies and the universe. In some ways, the prompts are complex, but in other ways, they are simple. This is so that conlangs both big and small can get something out of them.

The prompts will include five concepts all within the same category, example words from six different languages (one from each continent),<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> questions and ideas about each concept, and a list of words that are related to each concept.

Like last year, this Lexember will not be a competition (although the posts will be in contest mode). But, there are still a few basic guidelines:

1. **All top level comments must be responses to the Lexember prompt.** This lets the creative content stay front-and-center so that others can see it. If you want to discuss the prompts themselves, there will be a pinned automod comment that you can reply to. (Unlike the other guidelines, moderators will enforce this.)
2. **Include the number of new words at the end of each entry (or format them as a numbered list).** Do you know why I never published 2019's recap post? It was because I was counting words, and that was a hard thing to do, and I felt bad. This will make that easier. Sorry, Manti.
3. **Save your words on a separate document.** Unless you wanna lose them under a pile of Reddit posts...
4. **Be as detailed as you can in your entries.** Provide IPA, etymologies, figurative meanings, example sentences... as much as you can, within reason. Some days, you'll only have time for "ujadi = house," and that's okay. But the more you put into your lexicon, the more you'll get out of it!

**Prompts will be scheduled to publish at 1200 UTC (0700 EST) starting from December 1 until December 31.**<sup>[2](#fn2)</sup>

Happy conlanging!
