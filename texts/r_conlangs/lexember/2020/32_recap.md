# Lexember 2020 Recap

Hello, nerds! I hope the new year has been treating you well so far! Today, let’s celebrate one of the good things from last year: [Lexember](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Fireworks_in_Nagaoka%2C_Niigata_Prefecture%3B_August_2013_%2804%29.jpg/858px-Fireworks_in_Nagaoka%2C_Niigata_Prefecture%3B_August_2013_%2804%29.jpg)! I am extremely pleased with how everything went for Lexember this year. In this post, I’m going to celebrate some victories, fanboy over some numbers, and make comments on some of your Survey responses.

## Thanks & Congratulations

First, A few quick shout-outs:

+ Shout-out to Reddit’s new Scheduled Posts feature. It sent out every post right on time on a regular schedule, and I could sleep in.
+ Shout-out to [CLICS](https://clics.clld.org/parameters), [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page), and [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) for always (well, most of the time) being there for us when we needed to find something for a prompt.
+ Shout-out to [u/roipoiboy](https://www.reddit.com/u/roipoiboy/), [u/Cawlo](https://www.reddit.com/u/Cawlo/), [u/chrsevs](https://www.reddit.com/u/chrsevs/), and [u/Slorany](https://www.reddit.com/user/Slorany) for joining the Lexember writing team this year and taking on the sufferings that I had originally planned only for myself.
+ Shout-out to YOU, the users of [r/conlangs](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/), those who participated some days, those who participated every day, and those that responded to our [Lexember 2020 Survey](https://forms.gle/Gozqyv7WtTqpb7ZJ8). Your work does not go unnoticed, and we’re glad you’ve chosen Lexember on [r/conlangs](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/) to guide at least a small part of your conlanging journeys.
+ Shout-out to those who submitted an entry every single day! Those users are:

## Numbers

Now, let’s talk some numbers. This year was definitely bigger than the previous two years, but by how much? Let’s look at the total number on comments in previous Lexembers (counting entries + interactions as of this post):

+ Lexember 2018: **864**
+ Lexember 2019: **793**
+ Lexember 2020: **1,212**

A lot of the reason for this growth is due to [the subreddit’s explosive growth in general the past two years](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/kntykb/state_of_the_subreddit_address/), but I suspect a bit of the growth has to do with the higher quality prompts this year, as well as 2020 being 2020.

But what about _the most important number of them all_? This year, I asked you to include the number of new words coined each day. This morning, I scrolled through the comments and added all those numbers up to determine how many new words were added to all the different lexicons through our little event. Some entries didn’t include a number, so I had to count those manually if the format of the post allowed. A small number of entries weren’t able to be counted. Those that counted “.5 words,” I just rounded those up to 1. I am also counting the number of new lexemes sent to me from a friend who’s been following the prompts, but not posting them as comments.

Here it is…

Are you ready?

It’s big:

**10,250**!!!

## Survey

Next, I want to address a few common responses to the Lexember 2020 survey, which is still active if you haven’t taken it already.

### Regarding interest and usefulness of the prompts:

Overall, a sweeping majority of respondents found the prompts interesting and useful, and I’m very glad! However, we added another question asking which part of the prompts was most useful to you.

Almost 80% selected “Related Words” and almost 50% selected “Discussion Questions.” A smaller percentage (29%) selected “Natlang Words” and only one of the 38 respondents to this question selected “Images.”

This is kind of funny - in a cruel way - since I and the other Lexember writers spent more time finding the Natlang Word and Image prompts than anything else. This gives us a great excuse to not have to do that again. Thank you.

Thank you so much.

### Regarding accessibility for different level conlangs:

> They were very easy to come up with new words for, for expansion of my own baby conlang and I imagine for older, bigger, expanded conlangs.

> I thought \[the prompts\] were really great: interesting, thorough, and designed to be broadly applicable to many types and stages of development of conlangs.

These comments are very encouraging!! That was a big part of what we designed the prompts to do. We tried to be as intentional as possible to help conlangs both old and new by including broad concepts and specific examples and ideas. We’ll do that again next year!

### Regarding worldbuilding:

> The prompt discussions asked many indepth questions and helped me expand the lore of my conculture.

> They seemed to be more about worldbuilding than wordbuilding. I did answer the questions and even used them occasionally to generate words, but I felt like it distracted from Lexember.

Part of my personal lexicon-building philosophy is to “worldbuild while your wordbuild,” so I want users to have the opportunity to do that, and I’m glad a lot of users took those opportunities. However! The prompts had wordbuilding and worldbuilding sort of mixed together, so we’ll look at better separating them in the future. This would benefit conlangers who don’t worldbuild.

There were a few comments about how a handful of the prompts felt like they were “only applied to modern/western life.” We hear that, and we’ll watch out for that next year! ;)

### Regarding Natlang Word Prompts

> I would have liked the name of each of the languages the six prompt words came from.

> I didn’t like that the natlang words weren’t like labeled with the language they were from. It didn’t provide enough context.

Agreed. I put a footnote in the Introduction Post about how most of our words came from CLICS or Wiktionary, so a search for them on those websites, 9 out of 10 times, you’ll find it. We decided not to cite them in the post because it took a lot of time and I couldn’t decide the least clunkiest way to do it.

Based on feedback, if we do natlang words again, it’ll be more like the natlang word prompt from last year where we highlight one word and its definition as a prompt on its own.

### Regarding ideas for next year:

> I think maybe including metaphors or idioms would be interesting?

> I'd personally like to see some more ways to create derivational morphology in the prompts, maybe as a separate prompt for each day

> Topics beyond words like tongue twisters, idioms or phrases maybe

All good suggestions. I definitely want to do that!

## Conclusion

Alright, I think that’s everything. Thank you all so much for making Lexember this year tons of fun!

So, tell us how Lexember fared for you this year! How many new words did you coin? What were some of your favorite moments, prompts, entries? Feel free to comment about the survey responses, too!

Anyway, I’m tired and going to vacation away from Reddit/Discord this week. Please redirect all correspondence to idk [u/Slorany](https://www.reddit.com/user/Slorany) or somebody.

Happy conlanging!
