Hey y’all. Week one is done! How are you holding up? After yesterday’s discussion of KINSHIP, today we’re going to talk about twin topics of SEX & GENDER.

Today’s spotlight concepts are:

## TO ATTRACT

_atreure, hikitsukeru, mesabi, ʻumeʻume, páay, amombo_

Here’s where it all begins. What do your speakers find attractive and what sorts of language do they use to talk about it? What do people do to try and attract each other? What do courtship and dating look like for your speakers? Are there different named stages?

**Related Words:** attractive, hot, to be attracted to someone, crush, partner, boyfriend, girlfriend, to date.

## TO MATE

_kupuknga, 7ikbaik, amuna, miray, sangwaat, chwilan_

Allen made me call it “mating” to keep things SFW. I was gonna pick another word... What are your speakers’ attitudes around sex and sexuality? Are there any words that are taboo? Are there other words used to replace the taboo words? This is an area where there’s generally a really rich informal or slang lexicon as well as a lot of profanity. When there are taboos, euphemisms are also common. What are some examples of those in your conlang?

**Related Words:** sex (the act), to have sex, lover, sexual orientation, gay, straight, bi, ace, birds, bees, various words for genitals that Allen won’t let me say, various profanity for copulation that Allen won’t let me say.

## BIRTH

_xeire, nala, a-seung, fødsel, zaa, lindje_

Well, after mating this is sometimes the next thing. How do people in your culture treat birth? Are there ceremonies to celebrate it? Rituals around being a newborn baby or a new parent? What sorts of circumstances are there for pregnancy and birth?

**Related Words:** to give birth, to be born, birthday, midwife, newborn, conception, contraceptive, gestation, pregnant, pregante, pregananant, pergert.

## GENDER

_gnè, geslag, migdar, śota, suiaassuseq, ling_

Gender is often thought of as a spectrum of identity and expression with poles at masculinity and femininity. There are of course also expressions outside of just “masculine” or “feminine” which our next prompt also touches on. What words for genders do your speakers use? How about for people with those genders? Are certain things gendered in your conculture? A lot of languages have noun class systems that align with gender. Does yours? If so what does it look like, and if not, what noun class systems do you have?

**Related Words:** male, masculine, female, feminine, to present, to have a gender.

## TRANS

_kathoey, niizh manidoowag, hijra, fa'afafine, chibado, muxe_

I’ve done something a little bit different for this prompt: normally we give translations for the prompt word, but since the English word trans relies so heavily on Western ideas of binary gender, it might not translate perfectly. Instead, I gave indigenous trans and non-binary identities from six different parts of the world. Look em up and learn more about em! What sorts of trans, non-binary, or third-gender identities exist in your conworld? What sorts of words do your speakers use to describe them? What role do they have in the culture as a whole? What’s unique about their community?

**Related Words:** trans man, trans woman, nonbinary, a nonbinary person, genderfluid, trans (adj.), cis (adj.), to transition, to express a gender, gender expression.
