Fresh off the topic of COGNITION, you lot should recognize we’re halfway through the month! We made it! Right at the heels of the last category, we’re going to switch gears and throw the spotlight on the PERCEPTION & SENSES that inform our understanding. Get ready to sniff, lick, squish and listen as you gawk at the words we’ve got for you today!

## SMELL

_aiontéswahte', txeru, usaimen, nusa, buy, hongihongi_

Possibly the most overlooked of the senses, smell can be one of the strongest. We’re lured in by a variety of scents like baking cakes, grilling meats, or the perfume/cologne/shampoo of someone we care about. Others put us at ease like the gentle odor of flowers, hay, or fresh, clean sheets. Others, still, send us running in the other direction like smoke, decay or sulfur. Do speakers of your language associate any particular smells with specific meanings? Do they “decorate” for holidays using them like North American department stores do with fir-scented sprays for winter holidays? Are there any things a person might smell that would immediately bring them back to their childhood?

**Related Words:** nose, to sniff, to plug your nose, bouquet, air freshener, essential oil, incense

## TASTE

_nusdvagisdi, gosto, maitse, dhuku, amt, reso_

Salty, sour, bitter, sweet or savory, we all know and love our flavors and exercising our sense of taste. Those are the basic flavors, but there are of course other ranges, variations and sensations we can experience, such as squash being quite vegetal or “squashy” or chiles being spicy or even noting that something tastes medicinal when it resembles something metallic, cough-syrup-like, or is composed of herbs like ginseng, wolfberry or horehound. Do your speakers break their cuisine down into different sets of flavors? Are they particularly fond of blending any of the elemental tastes?

**Related Words:** tongue, tastebud, salt, acid, MSG, soapy, rich, delectable, tasty, to flavor, to season

## TOUCH

_másunuk, tutueutata, tapintás, kugwira, shokkaku, sentuhan_

Touch is one sense that can cause a strong physical response since the organ that registers it is our skin. While we float around in our skinsuits on the daily, we notice things like the temperature out: is it cool enough that I should put on more layers? Is that warmth from the sun just a pleasant sensation or the onset of a sunburn? Is the wind carrying dust AKA should I shut my eyes and mouth?

We can tell when something is slick or sticky, when it’s soft or sharp, when it’s wet or dry–how do your speakers talk about texture? Do they use touch as a metaphor in the same way some Western languages do (‘feels bad man’).

**Related Words:** skin, finger, rought, silky, velvet, to feel, to soften, to rough up, to texturize

## HEARING

_pohe, uyariy, clyw, ukuzwa, śravaṇ, panagdengngeg_

If you’ve made it this far, you’ve proven you’re a good listener and as a reward you’ll get the chance to define how your speakers hear and listen. It strikes me that the words we use to define how things sound are highly dependent on semantic domain, so if you want to dive into the music, lyricism or rhetoric of your con-culture, go for it! Tell us about what they find mellifluous or cacophonous. Do they have social rules about their own speaking volume in public, whether to not offend their neighbors or to hide away secrets from open ears?

**Related Words:** ear, loud, quiet, rhythmic, bass, treble, signal, to listen, to overhear, to eavesdrop

## SIGHT

_ootʼį́, qhaway, mkhedveloba, ra‘iyi, ruuparrone, paningin_

Hopefully by now you can see the importance of having the vocabulary to talk about the ways people interface with the world around them. The last sense we’ll be talking about is the one our eyes are involved in. Vision is an interesting one: it’s what lets us read written language (with the exception of braille), it lets us identify landmarks when navigating, to associate images with meaning so that we end up with symbols, and, perhaps most importantly, lets us recognize one another from afar. Do your speakers create any visual art? Do they have a means of enhancing poor vision like glasses or contact lenses?

**Related Words:** eye, pupil, cones and rods, to watch, to glimpse, sightseeing, insight
