Ready to hunt down some new vocabulary for your languages? Feel like coining new terms is a never-ending battle with yourself? Have weird feelings towards the Risk board-game? Today’s topic will help you hit your mark for sure: **HUNTING & WARFARE**.

### WEAPON

_hų́łoliną, mboka, zbraň, silaha, zevseg, meatau_

Tools meant for harm have changed drastically over the span of our history. What was once blunted objects, sharpened stone and bone or fire has become microwave-emitting devices and weaponized pathogens (if you buy into the Lyme-disease-escaped-a-facility theory). Whereabouts on their wounding journey are your speakers? Do they practice archery or swordplay? Have they got firearms of either the black powder or automatic variety? Do they use explosives like hand grenades, pipe bombs or missiles? Is there an equivalent to Greek fire or napalm?

Related words: axe, cudgel, spear, halberd, trebuchet, whip, trident, knife, brass knuckles, cestus, bullet, laser, photon torpedo, bow, arrow, arsenal

### HUNTING

_mil, chaquy, lov, adedada, šikor, pinyi_

Whether for food or for sport, the hunt remains. Do your speakers need to stalk prey in order to feed their families? Or maybe they win social points for the most lifelike taxidermy? Normally your weapon will change, depending on your prey: do they use rifles, shotguns, slingshots or snares?

Related words: BB, scope, suppressor, camouflage, lean-to, tree-stand, prey, to track, trophy

### BUTCHER

_náʼáłʼah, abater, levág, lemaredi, menjagal, wartirli-mani_

The way an animal is butchered is determined by a long history of the practice as well as other cultural or religious practices that require it be done in a certain way. Without fail there are prized cuts of meat, but also the off-cuts. What are these for your speakers? Do they process meat in any way that’s different from how your culture does? Do they dry-age meat? Do they cure it?

Related words: offal, sausage, lard, tallow, jerky, marrow, steak, loin, rib, chitlins, cracklins, sweetbreads, blood

### BY-PRODUCT

_sous-pwodwi, subproduto, sivutuote, yimveliso, yan ürün, produk sampingan_

Meat isn’t the only thing we take away from an animal. Some skins are able to be processed into leather or into hide chew toys for our domestic pets like dogs. Bones might undergo scrimshaw and be sold as artwork or displayed to commemorate hunts. Limbs might be preserved as sold as good luck charms. Furs might become bed covers or coats. What other reasons do your speakers hunt or raise animals?

Related words: pelt, glue, silk, wool, gelatin, tanning, ivory, ambergris, blubber, lard

### WAR

_ittilbachoba, ch'axwa, omi, impi, urush, yuddaṃ, pakanga_

The other use for weapons is to use them against one another to either defend what we have or to try and take more from someone else. It may change its ootd, but like the ubiquitous Fallout quote goes, War, war never changes.

Are there any notable wars in your speakers history? Have they got specific rules about how war should be waged? Do they practice by playing wargames with other nations?

Related words: battalion, soldier, armada, submarine, battleship, guerilla, prisoner of war, to conquer, scorched earth policy
