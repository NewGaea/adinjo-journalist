Earlier this month we looked at food and drinks, a topic which I hold very dear – and for good reason! Not only is food what keeps us healthy and alive, but it’s also the source of many of our daily joys. But we mustn’t forget the labor that stands as a prerequisite of any of this! Today we’re talking about **AGRICULTURE & VEGETATION**!

Today’s spotlight concepts are:

### CROP

_ani’, chakhra yura, Arnt, azekh, fasal, ani_

Before going any further, it’s a good idea to consider the types of crops your speakers might have. Do they have large, luscious groves of fruit trees? Big, wide fields of cereals? Maybe they only do agriculture on a smaller scale, having neat little gardens with different vegetables in them? Or maybe they cultivate a special type of fungus?

Additional words: cereal, fruit, vegetable, root, rhizome, to grow, to cultivate, to mature

### PLOUGH

_t’aklla, yvymbovoha, plov, maräša, bajak, waluku_

We prepare the soil in a few different ways, among others by ploughing the soil. In many cultures this is done with a plough – a kind of tool used for turning the soil or disturbing it in some other way, exposing it and thus creating an environment for seeds to be sowed in.

Do your speakers have ploughs? If so, do they have different kinds? Do they use animals to pull their ploughs or is it primarily done by hand?

Additional words: till, turn, furrow, hoe, ard

### SOW

_tarpuy, semear, killõ, zaraʿa, simda, rui_

Then, when we’ve ploughed and tilled the soil, we sow our seeds. Depending on the type of crop, this is done either by carefully placing each seed individually or by scattering them more or less randomly.

Do your speakers sow by hand? Do their different crops require different methods? What are these methods called? Do they have any tools associated with sowing?

Additional words: scatter, plant, field, seed, kernel

### HARVEST

_q'əpə́ŋ', aymuray, therízō, ḥaṣada, yeiʔtheìñ, kayas_

We’re ready for the fruits of our labor! When our crops are ripe, we harvest them, often using tools to make it easier. The time of harvest is usually bound to a specific time of year depending on the crop.

Do your speakers have a specific term for the harvest season? Do they use certain tools specific to harvesting certain crops? Are there any religious aspects to harvesting, such as rituals?

Additional words: pluck, crop, pick, sickle, yield, reap

### PRESERVATION

_neqivik, tlaolcalli, meteclēofa, meẖer, anbor, pātaka_

When we’ve harvested our crops and milked and slaughtered our animals, we need somewhere – and some way! – to store it all. Since harvesting of a single type of crop is usually done over a relatively short period, it’s essential that we preserve it somehow, since we can’t possibly consume it all right away.

Where do your speakers preserve their food? Do they store their produce in cool cellars or dug down? Perhaps their storage is in caches raised above the ground similar to the stabbura of Telemark or a qulvarvik of the Yup’ik? What about their methods of preservation? Perhaps they employ fermentation of some kind? Or do they pickle their food? And their meats, how are they made last longer?

Additional words: pantry, larder, granary, ferment, pickle, brew
