The mods of r/conlangs have got something you want and it just so happens that you’ve got something we want in exchange. I’m talking about more new vocabulary (and I’m also talking about those sweet, sweet updoots, but I guess that’s part of the BOGO offer we’re running). Today’s theme is POSSESSIONS & TRADE.

Today’s spotlight concepts are:

### GOODS

_ozhichigan, tlachihualli, bathar, mali, sin khā, oloa_

It’s the things we want; the things we think are good, quite likely the origin of the use of the word. Whether we’re talking about clothing, or food products, or the sort of tchotchke you buy when you’re on vacation and you think you need some sort of memento to be able to remember the experience buy, so you get a little silver spoon with a motif of the location that ends up spending the next fifteen years in the bottom of your bedroom.

Whatever it is that your speakers buy and sell, tell us about it.

Additional words: postcard, groceries, souvenir, magazine, product, utensil

### MONEY

_zháal, pirapire, love, koppar, æxca, kālā_

Folks fiend over money. But it’s no wonder when buying power can help you better your state of living (at least we tend to hope it can). We began with barter, moved through minted coins, paper money, plastic and now freshly harvested bits–what do your speakers use to make their exchanges? Do they have different values associated to different coins? Are they made of different metals? Do they trade with salts of varying quality?

Additional words: to mint, currency, denomination, change, to invest, to counterfeit

### TRADER

_adaawewinini, jimágui, kaupmaður, asitsala, soodalooçu, kaihokohoko_

Originally, I was gonna call this concept “vendor”, but it was damned hard to find a translation of that word in enough languages, which is why we’ve landed at trader. Besides, at its core, all buying and selling is, in fact, trading. The fun thing about language is that we often call vendors who sell specific things by specific names. Someone who works specifically in light metals, tooling breadboxes and horns, might be called a tinsmith. If you need someone who can help you both make a nice oak barrel for your wine and a sick bathtub you can soak in while you drink that wine, you can drop a line to your local cooper. Want to make sure your awful boss leaves you be? Pay a visit to your county’s conjureman who can work you up a charm with some separation oil.

What sorts of named trades and vendors do your speakers have? Are they familiar with any from neighboring regions that they themselves might not have themselves?

Additional words: profession, tinkerer, to tinker, blacksmith, brazier, locksmith, shoemaker, cobbler, butcher, baker, candlestick-maker, mazer, mason.

### SUPPLY CHAIN

_la chaîne de production, chèn ekipman pou, leverandørkjede, itsheyini yonikezo, sapurai chēn, mekameka tuku_

A supply chain is the composite of each stop along the buying and selling process. It starts with the people who gather up the raw materials, moves onto the people who process those into a product (or into components used in a product), before being moved to a storefront, a warehouse for an online store, or directly to your home. How do raw materials turn into products sold to your speakers? Is there any system of shipping that lets parcels be sent from one place to another? Do they rely on distributed schematics to recreate the same things in different locations? How do folks get the things they want and need?

Additional words: to distribute, distributor, franchise, post office, freight, bulk, to backorder, to overstock, outlet

### TAX

_ínáóltąʼí, impuwistu, keesh, gəbr, eñcil, buis_

A perpetual frustration of all folks who work for a living, taxes are unavoidable. Maybe it’s the money your speakers make that takes the hit. Maybe it’s the money they spend, if only on luxury items, alcohol, and voluntary surgeries. Maybe they have to pay taxes annually on properties they own. Are they having to pay out to local and greater governments? Are they monarchs, warlords, or despots profiting from the taxes of other folks who work the lands they have claims to?

Additional words: sales tax, tarif, embargo, royalties, tithe, tribute
