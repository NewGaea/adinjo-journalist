Today, we will turn our attention — and specifically our ears — towards MUSIC.

It’s safe to say most, if not all, human cultures have a concept of music. Making noises by striking wood, blowing into pierced reeds, or vibrating stretched wire-wound cat guts with horse hair… No, I swear that’s a thing! They’re called “Tshellows” or something.

Ahem. What I mean is that making noises that sound nice together is fairly universal, and everyone should have that! Even your conlang’s speakers and, yes, even you.

Today’s spotlight concepts are:

### PERCUSSIONS

_ʔostoweʔsaeːkaːh, huēhuētl, cymbale, gunzu, naqareh,ʻuliʻuli_

The most basic instrument, in its construction, is a percussion instrument. You only need one item, with which you hit another to make a sound. No guarantee it will be beautiful, but it’s a sound. What do your conlang’s speakers’ percussion instruments sound like? Are they short and hard-hitting, like a snare or drum? Or are they loud, lingering sounds, like a gong or cymbal? Are they used melodically, or for rhythm?

**Related Words:** to hit or strike, to resonate, to be loud, rhythm, drum(s).

### STRINGS

_Yakatat, charanku, cimbalom, ləsə, erhu, ʻūkēkē_

If your people have stringed instruments, what are they made of? They usually sport a resonance chamber that amplifies the vibration of one or several strings. How do they cause that vibration? Do they have different words for inducing a vibration with a tool, and for inducing one with your finger directly? Are plucking and bowing treated the same way?

What materials do they use for… all of it? As mentioned above, the first cello strings were made of cat guts, but pig and cow guts were also used, especially for cheaper instruments. And what about the more solid, rigid parts of the instrument? Do they also use wood? Which? Why?

**Related Words:** string, neck, resonance chamber, luthier, to string, to tighten, to bow, to pluck.

### WINDS

_Quena, kuti, salpinx, kuduzela, surpeti, pūtātara_

What do your people blow into to make noise? Do they even blow in things, or do they employ other strategies to create airflow, such as bellows or displacement of water?

What sort of sound does it produce? Is it used to play a tune, or to create [drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_(music))?

What do your people call these different types of sounds, if they differentiate them at all?

**Related Words:** reed, wind, to blow, breath, to breathe, airflow.

### PLAYING

_riwaktaa, tunai, jaialdi, tərə, chirekte, faʻataʻi_

How do your people say they’re playing an instrument? Do they distinguish “to play”, “to practice”, “to perform”? Do they differentiate hobby practice and professional gigging?

Does their culture value music? How much, in what ways? How are busking musicians seen and treated?

Who can play music? When is music played? How accessible is it? Does it have lyrics?

**Related Words:** to play, to sing, to practice, to learn, to master, to perform, stage, music, genre, concert, festival.

### NOISES & SOUNDS OF NATURE

_wakta, uiari, soinu, buf, hvov, vwatubwe_

Noises. Sounds. Onomatopoeias!

How do your conlang’s speakers deal with sounds that occur around them? How do they make them into verbs? Is their wind whooshing, their dogs growling, their mouth gulping, their maw chomping, their electricity buzzing, their tires screeching, their poultry crackling, their closed lips humming?

**Related Words:** boom, bonk, kaboom… Do I really need to do it for this one? They’re onomatopoeias! And uh, see the paragraph above, okay?
