# METONYMY

Howdy! I’m back…

It’s time to wrap up Nym Week with **metonymy**, which is a term that substitutes for another term closely related to it. Now, you might be wondering, “Haven’t we already done this?” No, no, no, that was _meronymy_ which is just a term that refers to some part of a whole. Totally different.

Anyway, we actually got ahead of ourselves and already talked about a type of metonymy in the meronymy post when we talked about calling your car “your wheels.” _Wheels_ is a meronym of _car_, but it’s only a metonym if you actually use “wheels” to refer to the whole car. To simplify a little here:

Meronyms of “car” include: wheels, engine, windows, doors, trunk, windshield, radio, seats, ignition, battery, radiator, brakes, muffler, transmission, headlights, taillights, etc.

But the the preferred metonym of “car” would be “wheels” since one would usually say “Check out my new wheels” when referring to a new car than, say, “Check out my new brakes.”

However, you can also say “Check out my new _ride_.” “Ride” is not a meronym of “car,” but it is a closely related concept and sometimes used to refer to a car, making it a metonym. You are referring to an object by what service that object provides. My personal favorite metonym is also of this type using “kicks” to refer to shoes.

We’ll sometimes refer to a thing using a term for a different thing that is closely related to it, like referring to a meal as a “dish.” The dish is obviously not part of the meal because you shouldn’t eat your dishes, but the word “dish” is often used to refer to a specific meal. It’s a metonym! And, for all of us linguists, every time we use “tongue” to refer to a language or dialect, we are using a metonym.

We can also refer to something by one of its primary characteristics like calling a human a “mortal” or calling a beer a “cold one.”

Sometimes, when referring to a institution or event, we’ll use the name of the city or area associated with it, like using “Hollywood” to refer to the U.S. film industry, “10 Downing Street” to refer to the UK Prime Minister and staff, or “Chernobyl” to refer to the 1986 nuclear disaster that occurred there.

We also like to use dates as metonyms to refer to events (e.g., “9/11” to refer to the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001). Sometimes we use the names of artists and authors to refer to their work (e.g., “a Picasso” to refer to a painting by Picasso). And you can also refer to an object by the material used to make it (e.g., “lead” to refer to a bullet). There are all sorts of types of metonymy.

All of this very closely related to the concepts of _polysemy_ and _metaphor_ (which we’ll talk about more later), but it’s more specific in that the metonym must be closely related to whatever it’s actually referring to. For example, “star” is not a metonym for “celebrity” because celebrities are not at all closely associated with literal stars.

Here are some examples of metonymy from u/kilenc’s conlang Légatva

**taspa** "country" Légatva is spoken on a peninsula located between various other nations and peoples. The earliest centers of power were coastal citystates, whose ports served as a waypoint for trade. A common metonymic idiom emerged: referring to these governments as _taspa u-tesa_ "sea and shore". As the citystates grew into a federalized state, so did the term with them; now _taspa_ is polysemous, referring both to the shore and the governments who controlled it.

**atlar** "police" While the traditional seat of power is the coast, the frontier towns in the center of the peninsula are the modern one. In the early days of these towns, postal carriers were known colloquially by their _atlar_ "bands", both the cords that symbolized their profession and the seal that wrapped their letters. As the towns developed into cities, the carriers took on roles enforcing laws and providing public transportation, too. _Atlar_ became the official title of that multidisciplinary force.

**makra** "mature"; **hora** "resourceful" Légatvan cultural beliefs divide a person into two parts, a perfect body and an imperfect mind. Many body parts are traditionally associated with certain related virtues and are often metonymically used to discuss them. _Makra_ "shoulder" is associated with maturity because the shoulder is used to bear weight; _hora_ "wrist" is associated with resourcefulness because the wrist is instrumental to craftmanship. Being a _pira makra_ "shouldery kid" is high praise for a Légatvan youth.

**nahozzi** "hooper" One of the most popular Légatvan sports is _tahęnra_, a mix of baseball, tag, and parkour. The way to win a game of _tahęnra_ is by grabbing _nahas_ before you get tagged; the team with the most _nahas_ wins. _Nahas_ "hoops" are dangled in precarious positions throughout the parkour course the game is played on, so snagging them can be pretty flashy. Naturally _nahozzi_ "hooper" became a slang term for _tahęnra_ players.

So let us know what you’ve got for today! Metonymy is often a productive process, so it’s fairly common for new metonyms to rise and fall rapidly in the history of a language, but sometimes metonymy can lead to semantic change or become so common that few question it or even notice. You’ve got a lot of options, and I hope the examples above give you plenty of ideas.

Anyway, tomorrow we move on from the -nyms and get into ways to build new words, edit old words, and change up words in ways that go beyond simple phonological processes. We’ll start with **clipping**.
