# CLIPPING

Now that we officially have all this month’s -nyms out of the way, it’s time to talk about different word formation processes present in the “langs” of the world. In a lot of the conlanging community, we like to shorten the word “language” to “lang” for ease of communication, speed of typing, and also as a indexical for familiarity with our community (it’s kinda like a slang term we use to identify with one another). This is a case of **clipping** (sometimes called “shortening” or “truncation”), which is when someone takes a term and eliminates an entire portion of it to create a shorter form. In fact, the term “conlang” is a result of clipping “constructed” and “language,” then compounding them together (this is often called a “complex clipping”).

Other examples of clipping that are common in the English language are “exam” for “examination,” “app” for “application,” “bi” for “bisexual,” and “gas” for “gasoline.” Clipping can also go the other way, clipping the beginning of the word and only using the last part. Examples of that are “roach” for “cockroach” and “phone” for “telephone.” Other times, you can clip off both the beginning and end of a word and use something from the middle such as in “flu” for “influenza” and “fridge” for “refrigerator.”

Sometimes, the clipped form can go on and begin to develop connotative and denotative meanings on their own separate from its unclipped form. For example, the clipped form “doc” is used in more casual or familiar situations than “doctor.” You can say “gym shoes” but not “gymnasium shoes.” A “bot” is not always the same thing as a “robot” since we wouldn’t call the bots on our Discord server “robots.” And sometimes the clipped form rises to such prominence that it completely overtakes the original term such as what “cab” and “pants” have done to the now obsolete forms “cabriolet” and “pantaloons.” Speaking of “cab,” the word “taxi” is a clipping of “taxicab” which is a complex clipping of “taximeter” and “cabriolet.” So “taxi” is something like a double clipping.

Fun random fact: My main conlang is called “Wistanian,” but among my conlanger friends, we’ve developed a clipped form “Wisto” which has actually been used slightly more often than “Wistanian.” This is, again, an example of clipping. (The “-o” might come from an analogy with “Canto” a clipping from “Cantonese,” one of the inspirations for Wistanian.)

Let’s see some examples of clipping from your conlangs! How does your language chop, snip, break, and crop its words to make new, improved, unique forms?

Tomorrow, we’re going to look at a similar process as complex clipping, but it involves two words that love each other so much that they make a new baby word: **blending**. Hope to see you again then!
