# LOANING

Unlike a mortgage, you won’t have to pay these loans back! When one language starts using a word from another language, that process is called **loaning**. You say that you **borrow** the word from the source language and the word itself is a **loanword**, even though…it’s usually not gonna be returned.

Loaning happens under a few different circumstances. If speakers of Language A learn about something new from speakers of Language B, then the A-ers might adopt the B-ers’ word for it. This is especially likely if the thing is particularly characteristic of B culture or the region B is spoken in. In English, we have loans from Nahuatl via Spanish for various sorts of Mexican things, from animals and plants like _avocados_ and _coyotes_ to food and drink like _tlacoyos_ and _tequila_.

Another common circumstance for loaning is when speakers of Language A accord a certain prestige to Language B, and might commence usage of B words as formal vocabulary such as _‘accord’_ and _‘prestige’_ and _‘commence’_ and…you get the point. English has historically looked to French for formal vocabulary since France was considered refined and fancy. Anyone who’s met u/Slorany knows better though…

Sometimes instead of adopting a word directly, speakers of Language A will translate a word from Language B literally. That’s called a **calque**. For example in French, the word for ‘skyscraper’ was calqued from English as _gratte-ciel_, which means ‘something that scrapes the sky’ so…yeah. Skyscraper.

_gan_ [ɡɑ̃ŋ] : god, deity

From Agoric _gan_ [kan] meaning 'god, deity'.

This term is mostly synonymous to the native term for gods/deities _thìma_ [t̪hɪ̰̀mɑ̃], but is often used specifically for foreign deities. It also occurs in the bipartite root _thìma gan_ [t̪hɪ̰̀mɑ̃ ɡɑ̃ŋ], composed of the synonymous roots, which refers to gods and deities collectively.

Who do your speakers loan words from? Are there ways to nativize loanwords? Any ways loanwords are treated differently? What happens to words once they get loaned in? Tomorrow I’ll show you something fun that English has done with a few loanwords as an example of backformation.
