# CLITICS

**Clitics** are morphemes that fall somewhere between words and affixes. Words can exist independently but affixes must be stuck on to another word. Affixes also mark meaning on a particular word, but clitics may attach to multiple word types and often mark meaning on a phrase or sentence level. The boundaries between words, clitics, and affixes are fuzzy and often depend on language-specific criteria.

A familiar example of a clitic is the English possessive _-'s_. Note that rather than with a hyphen, clitics are connected to their host with an equals sign. I've glossed _-'s_ here as `POSS` for possessive and _the_ as `DEF` for definite.

```
1.  I      went   to [my      mother]=s    house
    1s.NOM go.PST to [1s.POSS mother]=POSS house
   "I went to my mother's house."

2.  I      saw     [the queen of england]=s    palace
    1s.NOM see.PST [DEF queen of england]=POSS palace
   "I saw the Queen of England's palace."

3.  I      found    [the man with the yellow hat]=s    monkey
    1s.NOM find.PST [DEF man with DEF yellow hat]=POSS monkey
	 "I found the man with the yellow hat's monkey"
```

Pay attention to where the _-'s_ attaches. If it were a regular affix you'd expect it to attach to the head of the phrase--the word that most closely passes its meaning to the meaning of the phrase, in this case "mother", "queen," and "man." But it doesn't! It attaches to the last word in each phrase and it modifies the meaning of the whole phrase. It's placed as though it were its own word, but pronounced as though it were part of the previous word.

Clitics often mark grammatical information, or might include closed-class words like prepositions, pronouns, and conjunctions. Some things that are marked with full words in English are marked as clitics in other languages, like Latin clitic adverbs _enim_ ’indeed’ and _vero_ ’however.’

These are some examples of clitics in Metanoeon’s (u/ElNaqueQueEs) constructed language, “Tsiwe.” The typological scope of clitics in Tsiwe span several parts of speech, including quantifiers, determiners, nominal modifiers, and conjunctions. Though they are written apart from the host, they only perform their function when attached to a host and have no meaning of their own. They also possess no stress of their own, but can alter the stress patterns in their hosts, typically by shifting it towards themselves one syllable (i.e., _adak_ [ˈa.dak] becomes _adak ja_ [aˈdak.ça] because of _=ja_).

Some examples of clitic usage in Tsiwe are the partitive enclitic _=ji_ and the resultative enclitic _=ja_. The former attaches to inherently dual or uncountable nouns to reference a part of or one of that object, such as in _wewe_ “eyes” to _wewe ji_ “eye,” or in _alawi na_ “this water” to _alawi ji na_ “some of this water.” The latter appears in the answer to a question, attaching to the end of the question word (e.g., _adak_ “time,” _sene_ “reason,” _tsije_ “manner”) in order to give a response, introducing a new clause in the process. For example, if someone were to ask (1), a proper response could be (2):

```
(1) Sene   isi  le  ana-k   ni    se   leda
    reason ǫ    sᴜʙ go -ᴅɪʀ ᴘʀsᴘ  2    village
    Why will you go to the village?

(2) Ana-k   ni    kwe  leda     sene  =ja    tsi -k   las      kwe  wale
    go -ᴅɪʀ ᴘʀsᴘ  1    village  reason=ʀᴇs   see-ᴅɪʀ  be.able  1    father
    I will go to the village so that I can see my father.
```

What clitics exist in your language, if any? How can you tell they’re clitics? What sorts of criteria are there in your conlang that would let you distinguish, again if any?

If you don’t want to create any new clitics, are there any idioms or expressions using clitics? If you just don’t think there’s evidence for clitics in your language, then I guess today’s a wildcard.
