# IDEOPHONES

An **idiotphone** is what I use when I want to call u/upallday_allen to ask them what tomorrow’s Lexember prompt is. Hang on…sorry there was a little static, let’s try again.

An **ideophone** is a word that evokes some kind of sound, sight, or sensation. They’re familiar to us as onomatopoeia (which has a disappointingly low Scrabble score, only 16), words which represent sounds like ‘woof woof’ for a dog barking or ‘awooga’ for one of those old-timey car horns. They don't just represent sounds though. Ideophones can represent things like visual properties (the stars all _twinkle_) or motion (the malamute came _galumphing_ over).

Ideophones aren’t purely iconic, but they usually incorporate some amount of sound symbolism. In English, front vowels signal smaller and higher-pitched things, so a _whish_ is smaller than a _whoosh_ and a _clink_ is higher pitched than a _clunk_.

Ideophones can be their own part of speech in many languages, with their own distribution and rules. Other times, they can overlap with another part of speech. In English, there are a lot of ideophonic verbs, things like _‘swish’_ or _‘plunk’_ or _‘splash.’_

Here’s some examples from u/tryddle’s Pardang:

**mgabulu-dalubu** \[ᵑᵐɡ͡babuɭuʔɖaɭubu\] _id. (adv./v.)_ jumping up and down, not finding the right path to walk on; nervously; in an impatient manner; being overwhelmed by a plethora of decisions or options; (child speak) needing to urinate

**norro-lonnu** \[n̪ɔr̪oʔɭɔn̪ːu\] _id. (adv.)_ at night, in complete darkness; by accident, unintentionally; doing sth. unbeknownst to anyone; (sarcastic) being very good at something, being the best

These are entries from one of my conlangs, Pardang. In Pardang, ideophones play an important role in discourse, and may constitute a reply to a question by themselves. In their prototypical morphosyntactic environment they primarily modify two verbs, **ca** _"to make, to create, to do, to weave"_ or **ang** _"to say, to go."_ Below you can see examples using the two ideophones from above:

```
a) modifying ca
    kac yakka norro-lonnu ti-duy ti-ca
    1SG ERG   ID:at_night 1-play  1-do
   '[So] I am playing at night'

b) modifying ang
    pʼa7 maddi yakka mgabulu-dalubu 7ac-ang
    then frog  ERG   ID:jump         3-say
   'Then the frog was jumping up and down.'
```

As can be inferred from the examples, speakers of Pardang use **ca** when there is a predicate which describes an event; in that case, the ideophone further specifies the nature of the event, similar to an adverb. On the contrary, when **ang** is used, the ideophone constitutes the entire predicate. There are some ideophones that may be used with both verbs — such as **mgabulu-dalubu** — but the majority can only be employed in constructions with one of them. If a learner uses an ideophone with the wrong verb, the yielded result may be judged to be infelicitous or even ungrammatical.

Tryddle talks about how in his conlang, there are two different verbs for ideophones. It’s common for ideophones to take specific light verbs, especially if they’re their own part of speech. In English, cats go meow, but in other languages they might do meow, make meow, say meow etc.

What about your conlang? What sorts of sound symbolism patterns do you use? Can you productively form new ideophones? How do they fit into your language’s grammar? Are ideophones more common in certain registers? If you have non-human speakers, do they have any sorts of additional senses that ideophones might cover?
