# METAPHORS

A **metaphor** is a figure of speech that refers to one thing as being another thing. We often use them to highlight some quality shared between two things, for example I might say "My friend Carl is a real tiger." Obviously Carl is not _literally_ a tiger. But I'm saying he is one, maybe to emphasize he's ferocious or wild or somehow tiger-y in some way. You usually would make this kind of metaphor impromptu, and it depends mostly on some shared idea of what tigers are like, that you expect whoever you're talking to to understand. They also depend on some context--your conversation partner has to know who Carl is and why it would be relevant for you to say he's a tiger.

There's another sort of metaphor, that's sort of built into a particular language. A **conceptual metaphor** refers to the process of understanding or discussing one domain of ideas by mapping it to another. Speakers of a language will know some conventionalized mappings in their language, and they can use these mappings to build new metaphors that others will understand. These mappings can differ across languages and cultures. They're a good way to create a lot of internally consistent metaphors that can give a bit of flavor to your language, so when you're building a conlang, they can be a cool thing to think about.

Here’s an example of a metaphor from u/pastthestarryvoid:

In Blorkinaní the future is (metaphorically) behind you, because it cannot be known, and the past is in front of you. Note: In the gloss, “bl” is an agreement affix for blork, a gender in Blorkinani.

` Tlaboks         kerbubin       pozadz     bibs̪hab.`
`[ˈtʰlɑ.boks      ˈkʰə˞ɹ.bə.bɪn  ˈpʰo.zɑdz  ˈbɪb.s̪ʷɑb]`
`Tla‹bok›s-Ø      kerbub-in      pozad-z    bibsh-a-b`
`bread‹food›-ACC  hour-GEN       back-LOC   eat.or.drink\FUT-1-bl.IPFV`
_“After (lit. at the back of/behind) an hour I’ll eat a sandwich.”_
```

This metaphor also shows up another way. The future tense is formed by making all the coronal consonants dental (moving the tongue forward in the mouth). The past tense works the same way, except with retroflex consonants.

What are some culturally salient domains your speakers use to form metaphors? Are there any conceptual metaphors used across the language? Do speakers use metaphors in poetry or for rhetoric?

Get ready for the final day of Lexember, when we’ll ring in the new year with discussions of **idioms**.
