# The Lord's Prayer

## English (Base)

```txt
Our father who is in heaven,
   hallowed be your name.

Your kingdom come,
   Your will be done,
   on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread,
   and forgive us our sins
   as we forgive those who sin against us.

Lead us not into temptation,
   but deliver us from evil.
