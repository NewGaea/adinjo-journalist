It feels reasonable to call this the **King's Key** here as the Japanese name was ライオンノカギ literally meaning "Lion Key" -- and there is a fair association between Lion's and Kings, plus the metaphor of a king having authority to enter anywhere he likes.

### GRUMBLE,GRUMBLE..
```ngloss

```

### EASTMOST PENNINSULA IS THE SECRET
This line actually gets two translations, because it was heavily modified in the original English. The first is a direct translation from English:
```ngloss
\ex JURIASENT NI JURIA'HEM DAN VA AIRETOCHI.
\ft In the northeast, go north and find a secret.
```

The second is more accurate to the original Japanese hint:
### オカネガナクナレバ　ヤ　ハ　ツカエナイ
"*Okane ga naku nareba ya wa tsukaenai*," is the romanization of this hint, which roughly means, "Without money, the arrow can't be used."
```ngloss
\ex RÚPINU CHUMASTELA, NAYU IMATOCHA'MER
\ft Without rupees, the arrow cannot shoot
```

### DODONGO DISLIKES SMOKE
```ngloss
\ex DODONGO TOCAS KEJÉS
\ft Dodongo hates smoke
```

### DID YOU GET THE SWORD FROM THE OLD MAN ?
```ngloss
\ex AUR YI POPÓ'TAK TEN BORTOLOT?
\ft So, have you got the sword from gramps?
```

### TOP OF THE WATERFALL
```ngloss
\ex SUG XAMPTWARU KLOR HEMLÉ
\ft Go up the waterfall.
```

### WALK INTO THE WATERFALL
```ngloss
\ex XAMPTWARU NI'HEM MARTOCHI
\ft Walk into the waterfall.
```

### SECRET POWER IS SAID TO BE IN THE ARROW
Like the Eastmost Penninsula (sic) above, this line was significantly changed in the English language release, but unlike that one, this was for a reason: the special weakness of the enemy *Pol's Voice* was changed between the original Famicom and NES releases! In the NES release, *Pol's Voice* is vulnerable to arrows, while on the Famicom it was weak to sound from the Player 2 controller's microphone. Translations of both the English and Japanese hints are included here:
```ngloss
\ex NAYU CORI HARUDJU SALI PORAUN IC
\ft The arrow is strong against some foes
```

### オトニヨワイイキモノガイル
This line "*oto ni yowai ikimono ga iru,*" means something like "Sound is the weakness of certain creatures." Some translations say, "There are creatures which are sensitive to sound." As mentioned above, this is a hint to defeat the *Pol's Voice* enemies by using the microphone feature of the Famicom's Player 2 controller.
```ngloss
\ex DULA CORI ACENU SALI PORAUN IC
\ft Sound is strong against some creatures
```

### DIGDOGGER HATES CERTAIN KIND OF SOUND
```ngloss
\ex DÌGDOGGARU DULA I FANWE SUGO KEJÉS
\ft Digdoggers hate the sound of a flute
```

### I BET YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE MORE BOMBS
```ngloss
\ex YI CI'HEM WORKAIN I HUNYUGANU GORTOCHI
\ft I can increase your bomb carrying.
```

### THERE ARE SECRETS WHERE FAIRIES DON'T LIVE
```ngloss
\ex GAMBU NANEFA JENESAL... VA AIRENTOL.
\ft A pond where no fairy lives... Find a secret.
```

### AIM AT THE EYES OF GOHMA
```ngloss
\ex KUGOHMA AIMI, MUÉ IMAS'GALM...
\ft Gohma's eye, may we shoot there...
```

### THERE'S A SECRET IN THE TIP OF THE NOSE
Once again, we find a line which was massively changed from Japanese to English. In English, this becomes an apparently obscure hint about a single room in Level 7 (there's a secret passage), while the original gave you a hint a bit further out than the current dungeon...
```ngloss
\ex DAN VA OWALA I TONOX JUN UMASHTOL.
\ft A secret is hidden at the tip of the nose.
```
The Japanese hint here was more like:
### SPECTACLE ROCK IS AN ENTRANCE TO DEATH
```ngloss
\ex DJANE AIMINEMALNI KUJUMANAI LOTREK IC
\ft Eyeglass Hill is Death's Entrance
```
This was moved from Level 7 (see the above hint!) to Level 8, and the man here originally said:
### デスマウンテンデ　ヤラ　サガセ
Romanized as "*DEATH MOUNTAIN yara sagase*," this lets the player know something hugely important: There are arrows in Death Mountain that you need to find. As these are necessary to defeat the final boss, this hint is so important:
```ngloss
\ex NAYU FÌROM NONKE JUMANAI JUN UMASHTOL
\ft Silver Arrow is hidden in Death Mountain
```
### 10TH ENEMY HAS THE BOMB
Another interesting and drastic change. This hint is true, but obscured heavily by it's simple wording.
```ngloss
\ex I10 HARUDJ, HUNYUGA, CORITEMBA...
\ft 10th enemy, bomb, sometime...
```
This is because the original Japanese text read:
### ライオンノカギヲサガセ
```ngloss
\ex KUHIRO LONAK INDA NUQETOCHI
\ft Seek the King's Key
```

There are three major items in Level 9, or Death Mountain -- and this is the second hint to look for them.

## ONES WHO DOES NOT HAVE TRIFORCE CAN'T GO IN
```ngloss
\ex JONEIRINA, LOTREKA
\ft No Triforce, No Entry
```

## PATRA HAS THE MAP
The NES releases claim that Patra (a monster first seen in Level 8) has the map for Level 9:
```ngloss
\ex PATRA SUG JALMETÈN CHUMASTOL.
\ft Patra has the map.
```
But the original Japanese hint was:
### イチバンウエ　ノ　サカ　イメヲ　コクセ
Romanized as "*ichiban ue no saka ime wo kokuse*" this means "Destroy the topmost boundary." This is once again a hint to an item hidden in Level 9 -- this time the way to find the room where the Red Ring is hidden.
```ngloss
\ex AUROK I KIMARI KLORDYUR HUNTENSAI
\ft Explode the border of the topmost room
```

## GO TO THE NEXT ROOM
```ngloss
\ex AUROK RAKIM HEMLÉ
\ft Go to the next room.
```

## EYES OF SKULL HAS A SECRET
```ngloss
\ex AIMINU VA CHUMASTOL
\ft The eyes have a secret
```

This line was originally:
### アカイユビクヲ　ミツケ　タカイ
```ngloss
\ex TIMISH EBWÉSTA... AUR CI XI AIRENTOT?
\ft Ruby Ring... Have you found it?
```

## THANKS LINK, YOU'RE THE HERO OF HYRULE
```ngloss
\ex LINK, DAMACHI! YI KUHAIRÚL KENDIN TONSTON!
\ft Link, thank you! You've become Hyrule's Hero!
```

## FINALLY, PEACE RETURNS TO HYRULE.THIS ENDS THE STORY.
### Finally, peace returns to Hyrule.
```ngloss
\ex AGOJU, ASHA HAIRÚL'HEM WORKATON.
\ft After all, peace is born in Hyrule.
```
### This ends the story.
```ngloss
\ex HIMA BA KENDAN TOXS.
\ft And so, this story ends.
```
