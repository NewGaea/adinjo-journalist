# Translation Conventions & Limitations
[Index](translations/projects/games/gb-c-a/pokemon-rgb/pokemon-red-green-blue.md) | [Next](translations/projects/games/gb-c-a/pokemon-rgb/02-menus-pregame.md)

This translation is designed to be insertable into a GameBoy ROM image for the U.S. English releases of Pokémon Red Version and Pokémon Blue Version. This means it may need to abbreviate some Adinjo words in atypical ways, and otherwise limit certain things.

## Pokémon Terms
In the Adinjo Journalist translation, the following terms are used to fit the constraints of the GameBoy display memory limitations:

- The term POKéMON is preserved from English. They are never referred to as "pocket monsters" in this translation, only POKéMON.
- The types are:
	- NORMAL ${\rightarrow}$ **KIZUEN**
	- FIRE ${\rightarrow}$ **GIF**
	- WATER ${\rightarrow}$ **TWAR**
	- ELECTRIC ${\rightarrow}$ **ANESH**
	- GRASS ${\rightarrow}$ **XAGI**
	- ICE ${\rightarrow}$ **ELZ**
	- FIGHTING ${\rightarrow}$ **LEKAKE**
	- POISON ${\rightarrow}$ **DAHAN**
	- GROUND ${\rightarrow}$ **JALU**
	- FLYING ${\rightarrow}$ **KIRMAGELLA** (**KIRMA**)
	- PSYCHIC ${\rightarrow}$ **ENROS**
	- BUG ${\rightarrow}$ **RUBAN**
	- ROCK ${\rightarrow}$ **NOC**
	- GHOST ${\rightarrow}$ **LAV**
	- DRAGON ${\rightarrow}$ **DRAIKAN**
- Potions in Pokémon are medicine, not magic, and should not be referred to as **Almen** -- this term should be reserved for Ether and Full Ether items. The proper term has not yet been decided.
- BALL should be translated as **DURAB** "trap" in all forms of POKéBALL. If space is a duncern, use **DURB**:
	- POKé BALL ${\rightarrow}$ **POKé DURAB**
	- GREAT BALL ${\rightarrow}$ **CHURITO DURAB**
	- ULTRA BALL ${\rightarrow}$ **KEL DURAB**
	- MASTER BALL ${\rightarrow}$ **TALA DURAB**
- Pokémon names should be translated and localized into Adinjo Journalist
	- Where a name is shared between JP and EN releases, the name should generally be phonetically preserved in ADJ as well.
		- For example, **ピカチュウ** is phoneticized in English as **Pikachu** and this should be preserved with Adinjo **Píkachu**.
	- Where a name is altered between localizations, the pun or joke values of both of JP and EN may be considered and preserved, or a new pun or joke should be made in a similar vein.
		- For example, **<ruby>フシギダネ<rt>fushigi-dane</rt></ruby>** means something like "mystery seed" or "mysterious seed" while **Bulbasaur** refers to a seed, a dinosaur, and the word *bizarre* (though the last is somewhat obscured by spelling). Adinjo should seek a way to create a "bizarre" or "mysterious" pun relating to a seed.
