Oh, Navi the fairy...

Listen to my words, the words of

the Deku Tree...

Dost thou sense it?

The climate of evil descending

upon this realm...

Malevolent forces even now are

mustering to attack our land

of Hyrule...

For so long, the Kokiri Forest, the

source of life, has stood as a

barrier, deterring outsiders and

maintaining the order of the world...

But...before this tremendous evil

power, even my power is as

nothing...

It seems the time has come for

the boy without a fairy to begin

his journey...

The youth whose destiny it is to

lead Hyrule to the path of

justice and truth...

Navi...go now! Find our young

friend and guide him to me...

I do not have much time left.

Fly, Navi, fly! The fate of the

forest, nay, the world, depends

upon thee!

Ah, Navi sug nanef...

Jimartot, kuyi dekcin, sug dekcin i

sug Deku Øhagi.

Aur kempo ci falc øi?

Dan morent i walu blut'hemle

Dan mahi i walu ic ju

sug muri, Hairul.

Inda atemba, ba Kokiri Ølari,

nokef i jenesis, icikun dan qalem,

folrekun øandaru,
