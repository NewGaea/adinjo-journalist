**Aur coridul shoxemu romoju treno, hi yuganu umashton?**

**Romoju bacinu, jontu jiai lamo, xi atakama umashtona.**
"_Rainbows are seen, but they're only daydreams, they're keeping nothing inside._"

**Ki ba deku kimbancon, cori din xi çotas,**
"_We inherited these words, some folks trust them,_"
**Shi rank ic, yi ijinton.**
"_They are wrong, I am certain._"

**Cori jia airentoçi FAILES ROMOJI**
"_Some day we will find the RAINBOW ROMANCE,_"
**Afailtax, ajontax, hi yi.**
"_All lovers, all dreamers, and me._"
