# Article 1
This is first article of the **Universal Declaration of Human Rights** as translated into *Adinjo Journalist* as of 2023-Aug-13. The objective was to coin no entirely new words if possible, and to prefer coining compounds out of existing words if necessary. This translation also reflects that the Adin have encountered other sapient life whom they include in their conception of "People."

As a note, the document itself is titled **Lakulu Yanicin inda Ijinau Adinu hi Shinu Nolibrau Alnomu** or "Legal Statement for Sapient People and their Freedom(s) by Law" -- a bit of a mouthful, though it's often shortened to **Yanicin Adinu Nolibrau Alnomu** which is a bit shorter as merely, "Statement on Personal Freedoms by Law."

## English 
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
## Adinjo Journalist
Kami dynu ijinau, kuri banu livrau hi orom lakulu i nahertuma gayatolot. Shinu chijn hi rist-kirénos bancolot, bakira lanadin ni lav i andévo hi ancoté kejastolochigalm.

## Translation of Adinjo
Among sapient people, all these are by law of nature born free and equal. They are given to reason and right-wishing, therefore each to the other ought to act continually in a spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood.
