## Context

The purpose of this translation exercise is to tell a short historical story.

### Commentary

This is a cleanly formatted sample using UTF-8 encoded English. **Take Note** that the inline HTML tag \<br/\> may be used to separate lines for formatting purposes, while the blank line paragraph separator is used between verses or segments of a poem or song.

Several challenges are included below to help you push yourself with this exercise!

### Challenges

**How would you translate this to fit into the text limitations of this game?**

Consider that the text graphics, and space for text, on the NES cartridge were limited. In particular, everything on an NES display is composed of 8x8 tiles drawn from one of two _pattern tables_ in memory -- given a limit of 256 tiles per pattern table, they could only make so many text characters.

> **Task 1:** _If pressed, can you tell this story in a smaller subset of your language's written form than having every glyph available?_

The English version required an extra screen of text over the Japanese version, and the widest line of text presented in either version is 27 characters long, but in theory you could fit 32 characters across.

The original japanese text, in the game, occupies 161 bytes.

> **Task 2:** _If you are limited to 320 glyphs in total, can you tell this story in your language?_

The programmers were originally so pressed to fit in all the symbols they needed to tell this story in the limited memory available to them that they kept the _dakuten_ and _handakuten_ symbols separate, using two characters when they needed to present `パ`, `ボ`, `ゾ`, `が`, `び`, `べ`, and `で`.

> **Task 3:** _How might you simplify text if forced to encode it in limited memory or formats?_
