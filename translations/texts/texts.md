# Small Translation Index

As of 2024, I have decided to re-translate all of my old texts -- and to remove the temptation of relying or returning to the old translations, I am clearing all of my translations prior to late 2023: Specifically any translation prior to "Battle" from *Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks* is going to be deleted from the working branch, for the sake of re-translation.

However, in order to re-translate these texts, this index will serve as a list of the texts and a table of contents.

Large translations, such as whole books (even easy books) should be moved from the **`translations/texts`** directory to the **`translations/projects`** directory.

# Literature
These are translations from literature or storytelling media of various sorts. 

## Green Eggs and Ham
Translation File: [Green Eggs and Ham](../projects/books/green-eggs-and-ham)

A translation of Dr. Seuss' *Green Eggs and Ham*, which demonstrates repetition patterns in parallel sentence structures. This has been moved from **`texts`** to [**`projects`**](translations/projects) as of 2024-Mar-15

## "In a hole in the ground..."
Translation File: [The Hobbit - Opening Line](translations/texts/literature/hobbit_01.md)

## One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish
Translation File: [One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish](../projects/books/one-fish-two-fish)

A translation of Dr. Seuss' *One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish*, which demonstrates descriptions. This book also serves to test the ability of a language to represent nonce words. This has been moved from **`texts`** to [**`projects`**](translations/projects) as of 2024-Mar-15

## Steamed Hams
Translation File: [Steamed Hams](steamed-hams)

A transcription of the script and "stage directions" from a skit in *The Simpson's*. A good test for deceptive wording, word play, and verbal particles and filler sounds.

# Music
A collection of translations of music, particularly of lyrics.
